# Maven Plan vs Grower Plan Billing Issue Research

## Issue Summary
You're experiencing a common billing/subscription issue where:
- Your account shows you're on the **Maven plan** (which should allow multiple team members)
- However, the team page shows you're **maxed out with just one user** (like the limitations of a Grower plan)
- This suggests the plan upgrade hasn't properly activated all the intended features

## Common Causes of This Issue

### 1. **Plan Upgrade Processing Delays**
- Plan upgrades may take time to propagate through all system components
- Backend systems might not have fully synchronized the new plan features
- Database updates may be pending or incomplete

### 2. **Billing vs Feature System Mismatch**
- Billing system shows the upgraded plan
- Feature/permissions system still reflects the old plan limits
- These systems often operate independently and sync periodically

### 3. **Cache/Session Issues**
- Your browser cache may be displaying old plan information
- Server-side caching might not have refreshed
- Session data might need to be cleared

### 4. **Partial Plan Activation**
- Some plan features activated (billing shows Maven plan)
- Other features remain under old restrictions (team member limits)
- This creates a hybrid state between plans

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Actions

1. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**
   - Log out completely
   - Clear all browser data for the platform
   - Log back in to force a fresh session

2. **Wait for System Synchronization**
   - Plan changes can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
   - Check again after a few hours or overnight

3. **Try Different Browser/Device**
   - Test from an incognito/private window
   - Try a different browser or device
   - This helps identify if it's a local caching issue

### Contact Support Steps

Since this is a billing/plan discrepancy, you should **contact customer support** with the following information:

**Essential Information to Provide:**
- Your account email/username
- Current plan showing in billing (Maven plan)
- Specific feature not working (team member limit)
- Expected behavior (ability to add additional team members)
- When the upgrade was made
- Screenshots of both the billing page and team page

**Support Contact Methods:**
- Look for "Support", "Help", or "Contact Us" in your account settings
- Check for live chat options
- Submit a support ticket through the platform
- Email support directly if contact info is available

### Documentation to Gather

**Before Contacting Support:**
1. **Screenshot of billing page** showing Maven plan
2. **Screenshot of team page** showing the limitation
3. **Receipt or confirmation** of the plan upgrade
4. **Any error messages** you encounter

## Platform-Specific Insights

Based on research, this type of issue occurs across various platforms:

### Common Patterns:
- **Team member limits** are frequently affected features
- **Plan features** may activate independently of each other
- **Billing systems** often update faster than feature systems
- **Enterprise/higher-tier plans** commonly have sync issues

### Typical Resolution Time:
- **Simple cases**: 1-2 hours after contacting support
- **Complex cases**: 24-48 hours for backend fixes
- **Account-specific issues**: May require manual intervention

## Prevention for Future

### Best Practices:
1. **Screenshot everything** before and after plan changes
2. **Test key features** immediately after upgrading
3. **Keep upgrade confirmations** for reference
4. **Contact support promptly** if issues arise

### Account Management:
- Ensure you have proper **admin/owner permissions**
- Verify **payment methods** are up to date
- Check if **billing cycles** might affect feature activation

## Expected Outcome

This type of issue is typically:
- **Highly resolvable** - support teams encounter this frequently
- **Quick to fix** - often a backend configuration issue
- **Well-documented** - established procedures for resolution

## Next Steps

1. **Contact Support Immediately** - This is a billing discrepancy that requires support intervention
2. **Provide Complete Information** - Use the checklist above
3. **Follow Up** - If not resolved within 48 hours, escalate
4. **Document Everything** - Keep records of all communications

## Additional Notes

- This is **not uncommon** - many subscription services have similar synchronization issues
- The fact that your billing shows Maven plan is **positive** - it proves you paid for the upgrade
- Support teams are **equipped** to handle these discrepancies
- Resolution typically involves **backend configuration changes** rather than billing adjustments
