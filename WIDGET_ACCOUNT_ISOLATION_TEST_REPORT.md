# Widget Account Isolation Test Report

## Overview
This report documents the testing of account isolation fixes for widgets and reviews functionality in the PromptReviews application. The testing focused on ensuring that widget data, review management, and settings are properly isolated between different accounts when using the account switcher.

## Code Analysis Summary

### Key Components Analyzed

#### 1. Widget Dashboard (`/src/app/(app)/dashboard/widget/page.tsx`)
**Account Isolation Implementation:**
- ✅ Uses `useWidgets` hook which properly integrates with account selection
- ✅ Has account switch event listeners that clear widget selections (lines 64-88)
- ✅ Clears localStorage on account switch to prevent data leakage
- ✅ Passes `selectedAccount` to child components for proper context

**Key Features:**
- Automatically clears widget selection when account changes
- Handles fake demo widget properly for accounts with no widgets
- Fetches full widget data with account-specific validation

#### 2. useWidgets Hook (`/src/app/(app)/dashboard/widget/hooks/useWidgets.ts`)
**Account Isolation Implementation:**
- ✅ Uses `useAccountSelection` hook for proper account context
- ✅ Filters widgets by `selectedAccount.account_id` in database queries (line 67)
- ✅ Clears widgets list when account changes (line 94)
- ✅ All CRUD operations use the selected account ID

**Key Features:**
- Debounced fetching to prevent excessive API calls
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Proper error handling with account context validation

#### 3. ReviewManagementModal (`/src/app/(app)/dashboard/widget/components/ReviewManagementModal.tsx`)
**Account Isolation Implementation:**
- ✅ Receives `accountId` as a required prop from parent component
- ✅ Validates widget ownership against account ID (lines 228-253)
- ✅ Filters reviews by account via join with prompt_pages (lines 262-276)
- ✅ Double validation before saving reviews (lines 700-726)

**Key Features:**
- Account validation on modal open
- Review fetching filtered by account ID
- Proper error handling with account context checks
- Auto-closes modal if widget becomes inaccessible

#### 4. Widget API Endpoint (`/src/app/(app)/api/widgets/[id]/route.ts`)
**Account Isolation Implementation:**
- ✅ Uses `getRequestAccountId` utility for proper account context (lines 80, 326, 383)
- ✅ Filters all operations by account ID in database queries
- ✅ Supports both authenticated dashboard requests and public widget embeds
- ✅ Proper error handling with 403 responses for unauthorized access

**Key Features:**
- Request-scoped authentication for dashboard access
- Public access for widget embeds without compromising security
- Comprehensive CORS handling for cross-domain embedding

#### 5. ApiClient (`/src/utils/apiClient.ts`)
**Account Isolation Implementation:**
- ✅ Automatically includes `X-Selected-Account` header in requests (lines 64-68)
- ✅ Reads account ID from localStorage using user-specific keys
- ✅ Handles token refresh while preserving account context

**Key Features:**
- Automatic account header injection
- Token management integration
- Retry logic with account context preservation

## Test Scenarios and Expected Results

### 1. Widget Management Dashboard Test
**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/widget` with Account A selected
2. Verify only widgets belonging to Account A are displayed
3. Create a new widget in Account A
4. Switch to Account B using account switcher
5. Verify the new widget doesn't appear in Account B
6. Verify Account B shows its own widgets (or demo widget if none exist)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Widget list should be filtered by selected account
- ✅ Widget selection should be cleared on account switch
- ✅ localStorage should be cleared to prevent data leakage
- ✅ Demo widget should appear for accounts with no widgets

### 2. Review Management Modal Test
**Test Steps:**
1. Open review management modal for a widget in Account A
2. Verify reviews shown are only from Account A's prompt pages
3. Add/edit reviews in Account A
4. Switch to Account B
5. Open review management for a widget in Account B
6. Verify Account A's reviews don't appear

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Reviews should be filtered by account via prompt_pages join
- ✅ Modal should validate widget ownership before opening
- ✅ Review submissions should be scoped to the correct account
- ✅ Cross-account data contamination should be prevented

### 3. Widget Editor Form Isolation Test
**Test Steps:**
1. Edit widget settings (colors, design, etc.) in Account A
2. Make significant changes and save
3. Switch to Account B
4. Edit a different widget in Account B
5. Switch back to Account A
6. Verify settings remain as configured for Account A

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Widget design changes should persist per account
- ✅ Settings should not leak between accounts
- ✅ localStorage should be account-scoped where applicable

### 4. API Endpoint Account Context Test
**Test Steps:**
1. Monitor network tab during widget operations
2. Verify `X-Selected-Account` header is present in requests
3. Test API responses contain only account-appropriate data
4. Verify 403 responses when accessing widgets from wrong account

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All API requests should include account context header
- ✅ API responses should be filtered by account
- ✅ Cross-account access should return 403 errors
- ✅ Public widget embeds should work without authentication

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Account Integration**: All major components properly use account selection hooks
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of account validation (UI, API, database)
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Clear error messages and graceful degradation
4. **State Management**: Clean separation of concerns with proper context handling
5. **Security**: Row-level security combined with application-level checks

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Consistency**: Some components use direct Supabase calls instead of API endpoints
2. **Testing**: Automated tests would help ensure account isolation doesn't regress
3. **Documentation**: More inline comments explaining account isolation logic

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Fixes
- Widget dashboard properly filters by selected account
- Review management modal validates account ownership
- API endpoints include comprehensive account checks
- Account switcher triggers proper cleanup
- localStorage is properly scoped and cleared on account changes

### 🔍 Areas That Need Monitoring
- Custom review creation in review management modal
- Widget theme/design persistence across account switches
- Photo uploads in photo widgets (account scoping)
- QR code generation (should be account-specific)

## Recommendations for Manual Testing

### Pre-Test Setup
1. Ensure you have at least 2 accounts with different data:
   - Account A: Has widgets and reviews
   - Account B: Either has different widgets/reviews or is empty

### Test Sequence
1. **Basic Isolation Test**:
   - Log in and verify current account data
   - Switch accounts and verify data changes
   - Check browser developer tools for proper API calls

2. **Widget CRUD Test**:
   - Create, update, delete widgets in different accounts
   - Verify operations don't affect other accounts
   - Test demo widget behavior for empty accounts

3. **Review Management Test**:
   - Open review modal in different accounts
   - Verify review lists are account-specific
   - Test custom review creation and editing

4. **Persistence Test**:
   - Make changes in Account A
   - Switch to Account B and back to Account A
   - Verify changes persist correctly

5. **Error Handling Test**:
   - Try to access widgets via direct URL manipulation
   - Verify proper 403 responses and error messages
   - Test modal behavior when widgets become inaccessible

## Console Commands for Debugging

During testing, use these browser console commands to debug account isolation:

```javascript
// Check current account selection
console.log('Current account:', localStorage.getItem('promptreviews_selected_account_' + localStorage.getItem('promptreviews_last_user_id')));

// Check for data leakage in localStorage
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(key => key.includes('widget') || key.includes('review')).forEach(key => console.log(key, localStorage.getItem(key)));

// Monitor API requests for account headers
// (Check Network tab in DevTools for X-Selected-Account header)

// Clear all widget-related localStorage for testing
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(key => key.includes('widget') || key.includes('review')).forEach(key => localStorage.removeItem(key));
```

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive code analysis, the account isolation fixes appear to be properly implemented across all major components. The codebase demonstrates:

1. **Proper account context handling** throughout the widget system
2. **Multiple layers of validation** to prevent cross-account data access
3. **Clean state management** with proper cleanup on account switches
4. **Robust error handling** with meaningful user feedback

The implementation follows security best practices with both client-side filtering for UX and server-side validation for security. Manual testing should focus on verifying these protections work correctly in practice and identifying any edge cases not covered by the code analysis.
