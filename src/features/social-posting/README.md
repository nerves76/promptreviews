# Social Posting Feature

## Status: In Development

This feature is currently **disabled** and under development. The social posting functionality allows businesses to automatically post reviews and updates to various social media platforms.

## Current State

- **Google Business Profile**: Basic structure implemented but not functional
- **Other Platforms**: Not yet implemented
- **API Routes**: Partially implemented but commented out
- **Components**: Stubbed out but not functional

## What's Implemented

- Basic adapter pattern for different social platforms
- Google Business Profile client structure
- Universal post format for cross-platform compatibility
- API route structure for platform management

## What's Missing

- Complete Google Business Profile API integration
- Authentication flow for social platforms
- Post creation and management functionality
- Error handling and rate limiting
- UI components for social posting
- Other platform integrations (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)

## Development Notes

The feature has been temporarily disabled to prevent build errors while the core business creation and dashboard functionality is being finalized. All social posting code has been commented out or stubbed to avoid TypeScript compilation errors.
