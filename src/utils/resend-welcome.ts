        <p>Hi ${name},</p>
        
        <p>I'm really glad you're here. Even if it's just for a short ride.</p>
        
        <p>Prompt Reviews isn't just an appâ€”it's a tool to help small businesses like yours earn the 5-star feedback you deserve, without nagging or chasing your customers.</p>
        
        <p>In a world where big companies are rushing to replace humans with AI, you offer something they can't: real connection. People want to support small businesses. They want to give back. Sometimes they just need a little nudgeâ€”and an easy way to do it.</p>
        
        <p>That's where Prompt Reviews comes in.<br>
        It helps your customers say what they already feelâ€”it helps them help you.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Did you know:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Every 10 Google reviews = 2.7% more conversions</li>
          <li>25% of people check 3+ sites before making a decision</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Reviews matter. Let's make them easier to collectâ€”and more meaningful.</p>
        
        <p>ðŸ‘‰ <a href="${dashboardUrl}">Try creating your first Prompt Page</a> and send it to a few customers or clients.<br>
        Let me know how it goes.</p>
        
        <p>If you ever want help or ideas, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
