## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

### Post Editing

- [ ] Code syntax highlighting
- [ ] Markdown formatting

### Moderation
- [ ] Report post/comment functionality

- [ ] RSS feed per channel
- [ ] Webhook notifications

## üìù Technical Debt

### Performance
- [ ] Implement proper caching for posts/comments
- [ ] Optimize reaction queries (currently N+1)
- [ ] Add database indexes for commonly filtered columns
- [ ] Implement read receipts without performance impact

### Code Quality
- [ ] Extract shared types to separate file
- [ ] Add unit tests for hooks
- [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add loading skeletons instead of spinners

### Accessibility
- [ ] Add proper ARIA labels throughout
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- [ ] Screen reader testing and improvements
- [ ] Color contrast audit
- [ ] Focus management in modals

### Database
- [ ] Add full-text search indexes
- [ ] Optimize RLS policies (currently multiple queries per post)
- [ ] Add composite indexes for common query patterns
- [ ] Consider materialized views for engagement metrics

## üêõ Known Issues

### RLS Policy Complexity
- Direct Supabase client UPDATE operations fail due to RLS policy interaction
- **Workaround**: Using API endpoints with service role client
- **Proper fix**: Simplify RLS policies or investigate why multiple permissive policies conflict

### Auth Token Passing
- API endpoints require Authorization header
- Client-side fetch must manually extract and pass auth token
- **Potential improvement**: Use middleware or wrapper to auto-inject auth

## üí° Ideas for Consideration

- **Gamification**: Badges for contributions, helpful reactions, etc.
- **Polls**: Quick polls within posts
- **Events**: Announce and RSVP to community events
- **Resources**: Shared document library
- **Member Directory**: Browse community members and their businesses
- **Private Messages**: 1-on-1 DMs between users
- **Bookmarks**: Save posts for later reading
- **Following**: Follow specific users or topics
