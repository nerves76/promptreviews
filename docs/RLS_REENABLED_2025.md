# RLS Re-enabled Successfully

## Date: 2025-09-01

## Summary
Row Level Security (RLS) has been successfully re-enabled on all critical tables with policies that support:
- Multi-account scenarios
- Account switching
- Team invitations
- Service role operations

## Migration Applied
- **File:** `20250901000001_reenable_rls_with_proper_policies.sql`
- **Status:** ✅ Successfully applied to local database

## Tables Protected with RLS

### 1. accounts table
- **SELECT:** Users can see accounts they own or are linked to
- **UPDATE:** Only account owners can update
- **INSERT:** Users can create accounts with their own ID
- **Service Role:** Full bypass for admin operations

### 2. account_users table  
- **SELECT:** Users see their relationships and team members
- **UPDATE:** Users update own records, owners update team
- **INSERT:** Users create own relationships, owners add team
- **DELETE:** Users remove themselves, owners remove team
- **Service Role:** Full bypass for admin operations

### 3. businesses table
- **ALL Operations:** Access through account relationships
- **Service Role:** Full bypass for admin operations

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Multi-Account Support
The policies explicitly support users having multiple accounts by checking the `account_users` table for relationships rather than assuming `account.id = auth.uid()`.

### 2. Team Collaboration
Account owners can manage team members while regular members have appropriate read/write access based on their role.

### 3. Service Role Pattern
All tables include a service role bypass policy, allowing administrative operations from API routes using `createServiceRoleClient()`.

### 4. Performance Optimization
Created indexes on all foreign key relationships to ensure RLS checks are performant:
- `idx_account_users_user_id`
- `idx_account_users_account_id`
- `idx_account_users_user_account`
- `idx_businesses_account_id`

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Verified Working
- [x] App loads successfully
- [x] Migration applies without errors
- [x] No authentication blocking issues

### To Be Tested in Production
- [ ] User sign up flow
- [ ] User sign in flow
- [ ] Account creation
- [ ] Account switching
- [ ] Team member invitation
- [ ] Team member acceptance
- [ ] Multiple accounts per user
- [ ] Business profile management

## Security Improvements

### Before (RLS Disabled)
- **Risk:** Direct database access could bypass application logic
- **Protection:** Only application-level validation

### After (RLS Enabled)
- **Protection:** Database-level security enforcement
- **Benefit:** Even with leaked credentials, data is protected
- **Compliance:** Better for SOC2, GDPR requirements

## Important Notes

### Service Role Usage
The application heavily uses `createServiceRoleClient()` for operations that need to bypass RLS. This is intentional and secure because:
1. Service role key is only available server-side
2. All API routes validate user authentication first
3. Service role is used after user validation

### Backward Compatibility
The policies maintain backward compatibility by supporting both:
- Legacy pattern: `account.id = auth.uid()` (single account)
- New pattern: Multi-account via `account_users` table

## Monitoring

Watch for these potential issues:
1. **"permission denied" errors** - May indicate missing policies
2. **Slow queries** - May need additional indexes
3. **Account creation failures** - Check INSERT policies

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur, disable RLS temporarily:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.accounts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.account_users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.businesses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Then investigate and fix the policies before re-enabling.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to staging** - Test all flows thoroughly
2. **Monitor logs** - Watch for permission errors
3. **Performance testing** - Ensure queries remain fast
4. **Production deployment** - After staging validation
