## Articles Still Needed

I've completed 3 of 9 articles. Here's what still needs writing:

6. **`prompt-pages/types`** - Overview page listing all types

## How to Use What I've Created

### Option 1: Run the SQL (Recommended)
```bash
# Connect to your production database
psql [your-production-connection-string]

# Run part 1 (Universal & Location)
\i scripts/populate-prompt-page-articles.sql

# Run part 2 (Service)
\i scripts/populate-prompt-page-articles-part2.sql
```

### Option 2: Copy/Paste in CMS
1. Go to https://app.promptreviews.app/dashboard/help-content/new
2. Set slug to: `prompt-pages/types/universal` (or location, or service)
3. Paste the content from the SQL file
4. Paste the metadata JSON into the metadata editor
5. Publish

## Template for Remaining Articles

Each remaining article should follow this structure:

### 1. Content Sections
```markdown
# [Type] Prompt Pages: [Subtitle]

[2-3 sentence overview]

## What Are [Type] Pages?

## Why Use [Type] Pages?

## How They Work

## [Type] Pages vs Universal Pages
[Comparison table]

## Setup Best Practices

## Distribution Strategies

## Advanced Features

## Common Questions

## Measuring Success

## Pro Tips
```

### 2. Metadata Structure
```json
{
  "description": "...",
  "category": "Prompt Pages",
  "category_label": "Page Types",
  "category_icon": "[Icon name]",
  "category_color": "[color]",
  "available_plans": ["builder", "maven"],
  "keywords": [...],
  "key_features": [
    {
      "icon": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "description": "..."
    }
  ],
  "how_it_works": [...],
  "best_practices": [...],
  "faqs": [...],
  "call_to_action": {
    "primary": {
      "text": "Create [Type] Page",
      "href": "/prompt-pages?tab=1-to-1"
    },
    "secondary": {
      "text": "View All Page Types",
      "href": "/prompt-pages/types"
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Research Findings

### From Code Analysis
- Prompt pages use the Icon sprite system (FaHandshake, FaCamera, etc.)
- Individual pages available on Builder+ plans only
- Universal pages available on all plans
- Location pages integrate with Google Business Profile
- Video type exists in code but marked "comingSoon: true"

### From App Structure
- Three main tabs in `/prompt-pages`: 1-to-all, 1-to-1, locations
- 1-to-1 pages include: service, event, product, employee, photo, video
- Each type has specific icons and descriptions in `promptTypes.tsx`
- Location pages are separate and require GBP connection

### Recommended Icon Mapping for Docs
- **Service**: Handshake
- **Product**: Package or ShoppingBag
- **Employee**: UserCircle or Users
- **Event**: CalendarDays
- **Photo**: Camera
- **Video**: Video or PlayCircle
- **Location**: MapPin
- **Universal**: Globe

## Next Steps

### For You
1. Review the 3 completed articles (Universal, Location, Service)
2. Decide if you want me to complete the remaining 6 articles
3. Run the SQL scripts against production OR paste into CMS

### For Me (If You Want)
I can continue writing:
- Product Review Pages (similar to Service)
- Employee Spotlight Pages (unique use case)
- Event & Space Pages (rentals, venues)
- Photo + Testimonial Pages (visual testimonials)
- Video Testimonial Pages (coming soon feature)
- Overview page (comparing all types)

Each will be 2,000-3,000 words with complete metadata.

## Questions to Answer

1. **Do you want me to finish all 6 remaining articles?**
2. **Should I create them as SQL or markdown files?**
3. **Any specific features/use cases I should emphasize?**
4. **Do you want the "video" type documented even though it's "coming soon"?**

Let me know and I'll complete the rest!
