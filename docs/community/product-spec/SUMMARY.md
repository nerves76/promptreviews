# Community Feature Product Spec - Summary & Recommendations

**Agent:** Product Spec Agent
**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Phase:** Phase 1 MVP Validation
**Status:** Complete - Ready for Stakeholder Review

---

## Executive Summary

I have completed a comprehensive validation of the Community Feature roadmap and produced three detailed specification documents for the MVP (Phase 1). The roadmap is **well-structured and ambitious**, but contains **4 critical issues** that must be resolved before implementation can begin.

### Documents Delivered

1. **`gaps-and-questions.md`** (23KB) - 25 identified issues with severity ratings
2. **`acceptance-criteria.md`** (41KB) - 100+ testable acceptance criteria across 13 feature areas
3. **`ui-requirements.md`** (38KB) - Complete component specifications for frontend implementation

---

## Critical Findings

### üö® BLOCKERS - Must Resolve Before Implementation

#### 1. Account vs Business Scope Confusion (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Issue:** Roadmap uses `account_id` and `business_id` interchangeably
- **Reality:** PromptReviews has distinct account/business model where one account can have multiple businesses
- **Impact:** Affects entire database schema and RLS policies
- **Recommendation:** Use `account_id` consistently; community is account-scoped (all businesses share)

#### 2. RLS Policy Pattern Mismatch (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Issue:** Roadmap assumes JWT contains `active_account_id` claim
- **Reality:** PromptReviews doesn't use JWT claims for account context
- **Impact:** All RLS policies in roadmap are invalid
- **Recommendation:** Follow existing pattern - check `account_users` table for membership, don't rely on JWT

#### 3. Profiles Table Doesn't Exist (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Issue:** Roadmap assumes `profiles` table exists for username storage
- **Reality:** Only `auth.users` table exists from Supabase
- **Impact:** Migration strategy unclear
- **Recommendation:** Create new `user_profiles` table in public schema for community fields

#### 4. Username Generation with Multi-Business (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Issue:** Handle generation uses business name, but users can have multiple businesses
- **Reality:** Unclear which business name to use, potential for account leakage
- **Recommendation:** Generate handles without business reference: `firstname-hash` only

---

## Key Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Data Agent Work Begins)

1. **Hold Alignment Meeting** - Resolve account vs business scoping decision
   - Confirm: Community is account-scoped, not business-scoped
   - Update roadmap to use `account_id` consistently throughout

2. **Audit Existing Auth Patterns** - Document how RLS currently works
   - How is account context passed to backend?
   - What's the pattern for account-scoped queries?
   - Can we reuse existing utility functions?

3. **Simplify Username System** - Remove business name from handle generation
   - Format: `{firstname}-{hash}` (e.g., "alex-h7k2")
   - Display name shows first name only
   - No business context in usernames (prevents leakage)

4. **Clarify MVP Boundary** - Remove Phase 2 confusion
   - Move @everyone entirely to Phase 2
   - Move monthly summaries to Phase 2
   - Focus Phase 1 on: posts, comments, reactions, direct mentions only

### Architecture Decisions Needed

5. **Realtime Strategy** - Confirm Supabase Realtime usage
   - Does PromptReviews already use Realtime elsewhere?
   - What's the data fetching pattern (SWR, React Query, direct client)?
   - How to prevent refresh issues (per CLAUDE.md known issues)?

6. **Feature Flags** - Infrastructure decision
   - Where are flags stored (database vs config)?
   - Who can toggle them (admin UI needed)?
   - Per-account or global flags?

7. **Channel Membership** - Simplify or keep explicit?
   - Recommendation: Remove `channel_memberships` table
   - Auto-grant access based on `account_users` membership
   - Simpler model, less complexity

---

## Validation Results

### ‚úÖ Strengths of Current Roadmap

1. **Well-Structured Multi-Agent Approach** - Clear handoff points and responsibilities
2. **Comprehensive Feature Coverage** - All core community features addressed
3. **Security Conscious** - RLS policies, account isolation, and rate limiting considered
4. **Phased Approach** - Smart separation of MVP vs automation features
5. **Operational Safeguards** - Feature flags, staging rehearsal, rollback plan
6. **Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, E2E, and performance tests planned

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Requiring Attention

1. **Account Isolation** - Critical given recent issues (CLAUDE.md line 267-280)
2. **Mention Parsing** - Underspecified, needs detailed algorithm
3. **Error Handling** - User-facing messages need to be defined
4. **Performance Benchmarks** - Need specific targets (load time, query time)
5. **Content Moderation** - Profanity filter deferred to Phase 2, but abuse could occur in Phase 1

2. **Simplify where possible** - Remove channel_memberships table, simplify username generation
3. **Test thoroughly** - Multi-account scenarios, concurrent users, edge cases
4. **Feature flag everything** - Ability to rollback any piece is critical
5. **Monitor closely** - Sentry, analytics, error tracking from day 1

### Don't Do This

1. **Don't add JWT claims** - Security risk, doesn't fit existing pattern
2. **Don't include business name in handles** - Causes multi-business confusion
3. **Don't mix Phase 1 and Phase 2** - Keep MVP focused and shippable
4. **Don't skip accessibility** - Build it in from the start, not retrofit
5. **Don't underestimate account switching complexity** - Known pain point

### Consider for Phase 2

1. Monthly/weekly summaries with auto-posting
2. @everyone broadcast mentions with email
3. Saved/pinned posts surface
4. In-app notification badges
5. Content moderation queue
6. Search functionality

## Conclusion

The Community Feature roadmap is **solid and well-thought-out**, with a clear vision and comprehensive coverage. However, **4 critical architectural decisions must be made** before implementation can proceed safely.

The biggest concerns are:
1. **Account isolation** (preventing data leakage across accounts)
2. **Consistency with existing patterns** (RLS, auth, data model)
3. **Username system complexity** (multi-business handling)

With these issues resolved, the feature is **ready to build** and has a high likelihood of success.

### Estimated Timeline (Post-Resolution)

- **Phase 0 (Prep):** 1 week - ‚úÖ Complete
- **Phase 1 (Infrastructure):** 1 week - Data & RLS Agent
- **Phase 2 (Core MVP):** 2 weeks - Backend & Frontend Agents
- **Phase 3 (Beta):** 1 week - QA & pilot testing
- **Phase 4 (Launch):** 1 week - Rollout & monitoring

**Total MVP Timeline:** 6 weeks from blocker resolution to public launch
