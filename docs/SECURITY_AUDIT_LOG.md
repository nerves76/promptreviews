# Security Audit Log

## 2025-09-03 - Comprehensive Prompt Page Security Audit

### Audit Scope
Comprehensive inspection of all prompt page settings and features for potential account isolation vulnerabilities.

### Features Audited
1. Keywords and AI dos/don'ts
2. Review platforms
3. Special offer settings
4. Generate with AI functionality
5. Fix my grammar feature
6. Emoji sentiment flow
7. Falling stars animation
8. Friendly note popup
9. Recent reviews display
10. Kickstarters

### Critical Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed

#### 1. AI Generation Endpoints (CRITICAL)
**Files:** 
- `/api/fix-grammar/route.ts`
- `/api/generate-review/route.ts`
- `/api/generate-reviews/route.ts`

**Vulnerabilities:**
- No authentication verification
- Accepted arbitrary user_id parameters
- No account ownership validation
- Could be exploited to use AI features without authorization

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added session verification using `createServerSupabaseClient()`
- Validated user_id matches authenticated session
- Added account context verification
- Implemented proper error responses (401/403)

#### 2. Public Page AI Features (HIGH)
**File:** `/r/[slug]/page-client.tsx`

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Anonymous users could use AI generation on public pages
- No verification of business/account ownership
- Could extract business data through AI responses

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added authentication requirement for all AI features
- Added account ownership verification (`isOwner` check)
- Clear error messages guiding users to log in

#### 3. Kickstarters Management (HIGH)
**Files:** 
- `/components/prompt-features/KickstartersManagementModal.tsx`
- `/components/prompt-features/KickstartersFeature.tsx`
- 10+ form components

**Vulnerabilities:**
- No account context in modal component
- Could potentially access kickstarters from other accounts
- Relied entirely on database RLS without app-level verification

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added `accountId` prop throughout component chain
- Added account validation in modal operations
- Proper account context propagation from parent components

#### 4. Public API Data Exposure (MEDIUM)
**File:** `/api/prompt-pages/[slug]/route.ts`

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Returned full business profile with sensitive data
- Exposed emails, phones, internal settings

**Fixes Applied:**
- Implemented `filterBusinessProfile()` function
- Only returns necessary display fields
- Excludes all sensitive business information
- Added rate limiting protection

#### 5. Missing Business Default Inheritance (LOW)
**File:** `/dashboard/edit-prompt-page/universal/page.tsx`

**Issue:**
- Several features didn't inherit from business defaults
- Reduced functionality but not a security risk

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added inheritance for friendly note settings
- Added inheritance for kickstarters configuration  
- Added inheritance for recent reviews settings

### Secure Features (No Issues Found)
- ✅ Keywords and basic settings
- ✅ Special offer settings
- ✅ Emoji sentiment flow
- ✅ Falling stars animation
- ✅ Recent reviews display (API properly scoped)

### Security Measures Implemented

1. **Authentication Layer**
   - All AI endpoints require valid session
   - User ID verification prevents spoofing
   - Account ownership validation

2. **Data Filtering**
   - Public endpoints filter sensitive data
   - Only necessary display fields exposed
   - Internal settings remain private

3. **Account Isolation**
   - All components receive account context
   - Database operations scoped to account
   - Cross-account access prevented

4. **Audit Trail**
   - Security violations logged with context
   - Detailed error messages for debugging
   - Monitoring capabilities added

### Testing Performed
- TypeScript compilation verified
- Build process successful
- Account isolation logic validated
- Error handling tested

### Recommendations Completed
- ✅ Added authentication to all AI endpoints
- ✅ Filtered sensitive data from public APIs
- ✅ Added account verification to all components
- ✅ Completed business default inheritance
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive logging

### Files Modified
Total: 19 files
- 4 API route files
- 10+ component files
- 3 prompt page editor files
- 1 public page client file
- 1 API changelog file

### Deployment
- All changes committed to main branch
- Deployed via commit: 53468e2a
- No breaking changes introduced
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Future Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Schedule quarterly security reviews
   - Focus on new features and API endpoints
   - Review authentication patterns

2. **Monitoring**
   - Implement security event monitoring
   - Track failed authentication attempts
   - Alert on suspicious patterns

3. **Code Reviews**
   - Require security review for auth-related changes
   - Check for account isolation in new features
   - Validate data filtering in public endpoints

### Audit Completed By
- Multiple specialized AI agents
- Comprehensive code inspection
- Manual verification of fixes
- Date: 2025-09-03
