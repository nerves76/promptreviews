# Multi-Platform Social Posting - Agent Handoff

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** Ready for Team Pickup
**Priority:** Bluesky Integration with Google Business Scheduler

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SCOPE CHANGE (2025-10-18)

**Original Plan:** Build a standalone multi-platform composer.

**New Phase 1 Approach:** Extend the existing Google Business scheduler to support Bluesky as an optional additional platform.

**What This Means:**
- Users will see a checkbox "Also post to Bluesky" when creating/scheduling Google Business posts
- Google remains the primary platform (required)
- Bluesky is an optional addon (checkbox opt-in)
- Faster time to value, lower risk, natural integration point
- Standalone composer becomes Phase 2 (future)

**Read this handoff doc with the new approach in mind!** Some sections reference the standalone composer‚Äîthose are Phase 2.

---

## üéØ Quick Start

Welcome to the Multi-Platform Social Posting project! This document will get you oriented and productive quickly.

### What You're Building (Phase 1)
An enhancement to the existing Google Business post scheduler that allows users to optionally cross-post to Bluesky. Users will see a checkbox "Also post to Bluesky" in the Google Business composer, and when they schedule a post, it will go to both platforms.

### Critical Principles
1. **Never break Google Business posting** - existing flows are sacred and isolated
2. **Graceful degradation** - optional platform failures don't affect core features
3. **Feature-flagged rollout** - everything ships behind flags
4. **Account-scoped security** - all credentials use RLS with account isolation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Quick Reference

### Current State
```
Google Business Posting (ENHANCE, DON'T REPLACE)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Components: src/app/(app)/components/GoogleBusinessProfile/**
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database: google_business_scheduled_posts, google_business_scheduled_post_results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API: src/app/(app)/api/google-business/**
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cron: src/app/(app)/api/cron/process-google-business-scheduled/route.ts
```

### Target Architecture (Phase 1: Bluesky Integration)
```
Enhanced Google Business Posting + Bluesky
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UI Enhancement: Add Bluesky checkbox to existing Google Business composer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Schema Extension: additional_platforms JSONB column on google_business_scheduled_posts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bluesky Adapter: src/features/social-posting/adapters/BlueskyAdapter.ts (new)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Connection Storage: social_platform_connections table (new)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Connection API: src/app/(app)/api/social-posting/connections/route.ts (new)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cron Enhancement: Post to Bluesky after Google posting succeeds
```

### Data Flow (Phase 1)
```
User ‚Üí Google Business Composer UI (existing)
  ‚Üì
  Sees "Also post to Bluesky" checkbox (feature flag controlled)
  ‚Üì
  Checks Bluesky, fills content/media
  ‚Üì
  Submits to existing Google Business endpoint
  ‚Üì
  Saves post to google_business_scheduled_posts with additional_platforms = {bluesky: {...}}
  ‚Üì
  Cron job runs at scheduled time
  ‚Üì
  Posts to Google (existing flow, always happens)
  ‚Üì
  If additional_platforms.bluesky.enabled: Load Bluesky adapter and post (wrap in try/catch)
  ‚Üì
  Store results for both platforms in google_business_scheduled_post_results
```

### Phase 2 Architecture (Future: Standalone Composer)
```
Multi-Platform Composer (separate from Google Business)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UI: src/app/(app)/composer/** (to be created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Supports: Bluesky, Twitter/X, Slack (no Google Business requirement)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Unified Scheduling Schema: social_scheduled_posts (new tables)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Platform-agnostic cron runner
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow

**API Routes:**
```typescript
// src/app/(app)/api/example/route.ts
import { createClient } from '@/auth/server'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const supabase = createClient()
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

  if (!user) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
  }

  // Use account ID from session, never trust client input
  const accountId = await getAccountIdForUser(user.id)

  // Your logic here

  return Response.json({ success: true })
}
```

**React Components:**
```typescript
// src/app/(app)/composer/page.tsx
'use client'

import { useAuth } from '@/auth/context/AuthProvider'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

export default function ComposerPage() {
  const { selectedAccount } = useAuth()

  // Component logic

  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {/* Use Tailwind classes, Headless UI components */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Database Migrations:**
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251018120000_create_social_platform_connections.sql

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE social_platform_connections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  account_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  platform TEXT NOT NULL,
  credentials JSONB NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- RLS policies
ALTER TABLE social_platform_connections ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own account connections"
  ON social_platform_connections FOR SELECT
  USING (account_id IN (
    SELECT account_id FROM account_users WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  ));
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Breaking Google Business Posting
**DON'T:**
- Modify files in `src/app/(app)/components/GoogleBusinessProfile/`
- Change `google_business_scheduled_posts` schema
- Share components between Google and new composer (yet)

**DO:**
- Run regression tests before every commit
- Keep Google adapter registration separate
- Test Google posting after any PostManager changes

### 2. Cross-Account Data Leakage
**DON'T:**
- Trust `accountId` from client requests
- Skip RLS policies on new tables
- Use user_id alone (accounts can have multiple users)

**DO:**
- Always get account ID from session server-side
- Test connection queries with multiple accounts
- Add RLS tests for every new table

### 3. Cascading Failures
**DON'T:**
- Throw errors from adapter methods if only one platform fails
- Make Google posting depend on other platforms
- Block UI if optional platform connection fails

**DO:**
- Return per-platform results (success + errors)
- Wrap adapter calls in try/catch
- Show graceful error messages in UI

### 4. Token/Credential Security
**DON'T:**
- Log credentials or tokens (even in dev)
- Store tokens in localStorage or client state
- Return raw credentials from API endpoints

**DO:**
- Encrypt credentials in database
- Use service role key for credential access
- Return connection status only (not tokens)

### 5. Forgotten Documentation
**DON'T:**
- Skip updating Task Board status
- Leave decisions undocumented
- Merge without updating CHANGELOG

**DO:**
- Post daily updates in card comments
- Document "why" decisions in code comments
- Update `/docs/social/posting-notes.md` with key learnings

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
**Location:** Create alongside implementation files
```typescript
// src/features/social-posting/adapters/__tests__/BlueskyAdapter.test.ts
import { BlueskyAdapter } from '../BlueskyAdapter'

describe('BlueskyAdapter', () => {
  it('validates post within character limit', () => {
    // Test logic
  })
})
```

### Integration Tests
**Location:** `/tests/social-posting/` (create this directory)
```typescript
// tests/social-posting/bluesky-flow.test.ts
// Test full flow: connect ‚Üí post ‚Üí verify
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Connect Bluesky account
- [ ] Post text-only content
- [ ] Post with image attachment
- [ ] Post to Google + Bluesky simultaneously
- [ ] Disconnect Bluesky account
- [ ] Try to post after disconnect (should show error)
- [ ] Verify Google posting unaffected by Bluesky errors
- [ ] Check account isolation (switch accounts, verify separate connections)

### Regression Tests
**Must pass before every merge:**
```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Test auth flow
npm run test:auth

# Manual: Load Google Business composer
# Manual: Create a test Google Business post
# Manual: Verify scheduled posts display correctly
```

---

## üìä Monitoring & Rollout

### Feature Flags
**Location:** TBD by Product Strategist (likely `account_features` table)

**Flags to Create:**
- `feature_social_composer` - Gates access to new composer
- `feature_bluesky_posting` - Enables Bluesky adapter
- `feature_twitter_posting` - For Phase 2
- `feature_slack_posting` - For Phase 2

### Launch Checklist
Before flipping flags in production:
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration + regression)
- [ ] QA Agent manual testing complete
- [ ] Two agents have reviewed code
- [ ] Sentry monitoring active
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Support team notified
- [ ] Metrics dashboard created

### Metrics to Watch
- Google Business posting success rate (should not change)
- Bluesky posting success rate
- Connection errors per platform
- API response times
- Error rate in Sentry

### Rollback Plan
If issues found in production:
1. Disable feature flag immediately
2. Investigate errors in Sentry
3. Fix issues in staging
4. Re-test full suite
5. Gradual re-enable with monitoring
