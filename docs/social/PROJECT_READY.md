# 🚀 Multi-Platform Social Posting - PROJECT READY FOR HANDOFF

**Date:** 2025-10-18 (Updated with scope change)
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for Agent Team Pickup

---

## ⚠️ SCOPE CHANGE (2025-10-18)

**Original Plan:** Build standalone multi-platform composer

**New Phase 1 Approach:** Extend Google Business scheduler with "Also post to Bluesky" checkbox

**Why:** Faster time to value, lower risk, natural integration point for existing users

**All docs updated** to reflect this new approach!

---

## ✨ What's Been Prepared

Your AI agent team is ready to build the Bluesky integration with Google Business scheduler! Here's what's been set up:

### 📋 1. Complete Task Board
**Location:** `/docs/social/TASKBOARD.md`

✅ **Populated with Bluesky integration work items:**
- 2 infrastructure tasks (INF-1: Connection Registry, INF-2: Schema Extension)
- 2 API/cron tasks (API-1: Connection endpoints, CRON-1: Cron enhancement)
- 1 Bluesky adapter task (ADAPT-1)
- 1 UI enhancement task (UI-1: Bluesky checkbox)
- 2 spec definition tasks (SPEC-1: Plan matrix, SPEC-2: UX design)
- 5 Phase 2 backlog items (Standalone composer, Twitter/X, Slack, Unified schema, Media optimization)

✅ **Agent assignments clearly defined:**
- Infrastructure Agent → Database schema + connection API + cron enhancement
- Adapter Agent → Bluesky adapter implementation
- UI/UX Agent → Bluesky checkbox in Google Business composer
- Product Strategist → Plan matrix + feature flags + launch communications
- QA Agent → Regression suite + integration testing

✅ **Dependencies mapped:**
- Clear blocking relationships (e.g., UI-1 blocked until SPEC-2 + API-1 + ADAPT-1)
- Immediate next steps listed per role (4-step implementation sequence)
- Test plans defined for each task

### 📚 2. Comprehensive Documentation

- Useful commands reference

✅ **[Status Tracker](../status/social-composer.md)** - Project health dashboard
- Progress tracking by workstream
- Feature flag management
- Deployment history template
- Risk register with mitigations
- Pre-launch checklist (40+ items)
- Weekly status template

✅ **[README.md](./README.md)** - Navigation hub
- Quick links to all docs by role
- Common questions answered
- Update cadence defined
- Success metrics outlined

### 🎯 3. Clear Strategic Plan

✅ **[Master Plan](../../MULTI_PLATFORM_POSTING_PLAN.md)** already existed with:
- Goals and guiding principles
- Layered architecture design
- Bluesky-first scope rationale
- AI agent coordination playbook
- Quality gates and cross-checks

✅ **Implementation sequence defined:**
- Phase 1A: Foundation (INF-1, INF-2)
- Phase 1B: Bluesky Integration (ADAPT-1, API-1)
- Phase 1C: Composer UI (SPEC-2, UI-1)
- Each phase has clear exit criteria
