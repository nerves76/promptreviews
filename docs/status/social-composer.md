## 🔍 Active Monitoring

### Metrics to Track (Once Launched)

**Core Metrics:**
- Google Business posting success rate (baseline: maintain current)
- Bluesky posting success rate (target: >95%)
- Connection errors per platform
- API response time (p50, p95, p99)

**Error Tracking:**
- Adapter failures (by platform)
- Token refresh failures
- RLS policy violations (should be zero)

**User Behavior:**
- Composer page views
- Posts per platform (distribution)
- Connection/disconnection frequency

### Dashboards
*To be created:*
- Sentry dashboard for social posting errors
- Custom analytics for platform usage
- Performance monitoring for adapter calls

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### High Priority Risks

#### 1. Google Business Posting Regression
**Risk:** New code breaks existing Google posting functionality.

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Critical (affects core product)

**Mitigation:**
- Regression test suite runs before every merge
- Google adapter isolated from new code
- Manual testing required for all deploys
- Immediate rollback plan if issues detected

**Owner:** QA Agent

---

#### 2. Cross-Account Data Leakage
**Risk:** User sees another account's platform connections or posts.

**Probability:** Low (if RLS implemented correctly)
**Impact:** Critical (security/privacy violation)

**Mitigation:**
- RLS policies on all new tables
- Manual multi-account testing required
- Security review before launch
- Automated tests for account isolation

**Owner:** Infrastructure Agent + QA Agent

---

#### 3. Twitter API Approval Delay
**Risk:** Twitter app approval takes longer than expected, blocking Phase 2.

**Probability:** High
**Impact:** Low (doesn't block Bluesky MVP)

**Mitigation:**
- Start Bluesky first (no approval needed)
- Submit Twitter app early
- Have alternative timeline if rejected

**Owner:** Product Strategist Agent

---

### Medium Priority Risks

#### 4. Bluesky Rate Limits
**Risk:** Posting failures due to undocumented rate limits.

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (affects user experience)

**Mitigation:**
- Research Bluesky API docs thoroughly
- Implement backoff/retry logic
- Monitor error rates closely at launch
- Document limits in posting-notes.md

**Owner:** Adapter Agent

---

#### 5. Token Expiration Handling
**Risk:** Expired tokens cause silent failures or poor UX.

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (confused users)

**Mitigation:**
- Implement token refresh logic
- Clear error messages for expired credentials
- Prompt users to reconnect
- Monitor token refresh success rate

**Owner:** Adapter Agent
