# PromptReviews AI-Assisted Review System
## Provisional Patent Application

**Title of Invention:**
System and Method for AI-Assisted Contextual Review Generation with Human-Controlled Content Authentication, Multi-Modal Capture, and Physical-Digital Integration

---

## ABSTRACT

A computerized system and method for generating authentic customer reviews through contextual AI assistance while preserving human authorship control, featuring novel physical-digital integration technologies. The system dynamically generates contextual review interfaces containing business-specific metadata, customer interaction history, and location/service/product information. Customers interact with the interface through multiple pathways: accepting pre-generated business drafts, utilizing AI-powered content generation with human oversight, or manual composition. The system employs a novel human-authentication layer that ensures AI-generated content requires explicit human approval and modification. The invention includes breakthrough physical-digital bridge technologies including QR code generation with business-specific contextual metadata, NFC chip programming for contactless review initiation, printable template systems with integrated brand signifiers, and a comprehensive brand signifier recognition system where visual elements serve as user experience cues for simplified review processes. Upon completion, reviews are processed through a multi-destination submission engine that can simultaneously store reviews internally and distribute to third-party platforms while maintaining attribution tracking. The system includes embeddable widget technology for displaying authenticated reviews and supports multi-modal capture including text, photo, and video testimonials with contextual metadata preservation.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of the Invention

This invention relates to computer-implemented systems for customer review generation and management, specifically systems that utilize artificial intelligence to assist human users in creating authentic review content while maintaining human control over the final output, with particular emphasis on physical-digital integration technologies including QR code generation, NFC chip programming, printable template systems, and brand signifier recognition.

### Description of Related Art

Existing review collection systems typically fall into two categories: (1) simple redirect systems that send customers to third-party review platforms without context or assistance, and (2) automated review generation systems that create content with minimal human input, often resulting in inauthentic or generic reviews.

Current limitations include:
- Lack of contextual information during review creation
- No intermediate assistance between manual writing and full automation
- Limited ability to capture and preserve business-specific context
- No systematic approach to sentiment-based routing
- Inability to simultaneously manage internal and external review distribution
- Limited multi-modal capture capabilities with context preservation
- **No physical-digital integration for in-location review collection**
- **Absence of brand signifier systems that train customer expectations**
- **No comprehensive QR/NFC integration with contextual metadata**
- **Limited physical media distribution capabilities**

Prior art systems such as those used by BirdEye, Podium, and similar platforms primarily focus on review request automation and simple redirect functionality, but fail to provide the technical innovations disclosed herein, particularly the novel physical-digital integration technologies.
