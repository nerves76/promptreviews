# Security Improvements Summary

## Date: 2025-09-01

## Overview
This document summarizes all security improvements made in response to Reddit feedback about missing CSRF protection, lack of RLS, and other security vulnerabilities.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ **CSRF Protection** (COMPLETED)
**Reddit Comment:** "0 csrf headers, probably no cors either"

#### What We Did:
- Created origin-based CSRF protection system (`/src/lib/csrf-protection.ts`)
- Protected all critical endpoints:
  - Payment operations (checkout, billing portal)
  - Subscription cancellation (POST & DELETE)
  - Business/location deletion
  - Widget creation and updates
- Added security headers to middleware
- Created SameSite cookie configuration for supporting cookies (Supabase continues managing primary auth tokens)

#### Files Modified:
- `/src/middleware.ts` - Added security headers
- `/src/app/(app)/api/cancel-subscription/route.ts`
- `/src/app/(app)/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts`
- `/src/app/(app)/api/create-stripe-portal-session/route.ts`
- `/src/app/(app)/api/business-locations/[id]/route.ts`
- `/src/app/(app)/api/widgets/route.ts`
- `/src/app/(app)/api/widgets/[id]/reviews/route.ts`

#### Documentation:
- `/docs/CSRF_PROTECTION_ADDED.md`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ **Row Level Security (RLS)** (COMPLETED)
**Reddit Comment:** "Make sure you harden Supabase"

#### What We Did:
- Re-enabled RLS on critical tables (accounts, account_users, businesses)
- Created policies supporting:
  - Multi-account scenarios
  - Team invitations and collaboration
  - Account switching
  - Service role bypass for admin operations
- Added performance indexes for RLS queries

#### Migration Applied:
- `/supabase/migrations/20250901000001_reenable_rls_with_proper_policies.sql`

#### Documentation:
- `/docs/RLS_REENABLED_2025.md`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ **Additional Security Improvements** (COMPLETED)

#### Security Headers Added:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

#### Rate Limiting System:
- Created but not enforced (`/src/lib/rate-limit.ts`)
- Ready to activate when needed
- Different limits for auth, API, and widgets

#### robots.txt:
- Blocks sensitive paths from search engines
- Protects /api/, /dashboard/, /auth/ paths

#### CORS Monitoring:
- Widget API logs external domain access
- Maintains backward compatibility

---

## üìä Security Posture Comparison

### Before Improvements:
- ‚ùå No CSRF protection
- ‚ùå RLS disabled on critical tables
- ‚ùå No rate limiting
- ‚ùå No security headers
- ‚ùå APIs exposed to search engines
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Wildcard CORS on widget endpoints

### After Improvements:
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection on all critical endpoints
- ‚úÖ RLS enabled with proper policies
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting ready (not enforced)
- ‚úÖ Security headers on all responses
- ‚úÖ robots.txt blocking sensitive paths
- ‚úÖ CORS monitoring with logging

---

## üöÄ What Should Be Done Next

### Priority 1: Immediate Actions (This Week)

#### 1. **Test RLS Thoroughly**
```bash
# Test these flows in development:
- User registration with new account
- User login and account access
- Account switching between multiple accounts
- Team member invitation flow
- Team member acceptance
- Creating/editing business profiles
```

#### 2. **Activate Rate Limiting**
```typescript
// Add to critical endpoints:
import { checkRateLimit, authRateLimiter } from '@/lib/rate-limit';

const { allowed } = checkRateLimit(request, authRateLimiter);
if (!allowed) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Too many requests' }, { status: 429 });
```

#### 3. **Make Pricing Visible**
- Create dedicated `/pricing` page
- Add to main navigation
- Include in footer
- Address Reddit: "pricing is not seen"

---

### Priority 2: Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)

#### 4. **Implement CSRF Tokens**
- Upgrade from origin checking to token-based CSRF
- Use `edge-csrf` library for Next.js
- Add tokens to all forms

#### 5. **API Key Authentication**
- Generate API keys for widget endpoints
- Track usage per customer
- Rate limit by API key
- Document for customers

#### 6. **Security Audit**
- Review all `NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variables
- Ensure no sensitive data in client-side code
- Check for exposed API endpoints
- Review Supabase security rules

---

### Priority 3: Medium-term (Next Month)

#### 7. **Fix Automatic Page Refreshes**
- Debug 55-minute refresh issue (mentioned in CLAUDE.md)
- Implement proper token refresh without page reload
- Better session management

#### 8. **Enhanced Monitoring**
```javascript
// Add security event tracking:
- CSRF attempts blocked
- Rate limit violations
- Failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious API usage patterns
```

#### 9. **Security Headers Enhancement**
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Add Subresource Integrity (SRI)
- Configure CORS per endpoint

#### 10. **Database Security**
- Enable RLS on remaining tables
- Audit all database functions
- Review stored procedures
- Implement query timeouts

---

### Priority 4: Long-term (Next Quarter)

#### 11. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
- Consider Cloudflare or similar
- DDoS protection
- Bot management
- IP-based rate limiting

#### 12. **Security Compliance**
- Prepare for SOC2 audit
- GDPR compliance review
- Security documentation
- Incident response plan

#### 13. **Penetration Testing**
- Hire security firm for pentest
- Fix identified vulnerabilities
- Regular security assessments

- [ ] Activate rate limiting
- [ ] Create pricing page
- [ ] Implement CSRF tokens
- [ ] Add API key authentication

---

## üìà Metrics to Monitor

### Security Metrics:
```sql
-- Track these in your logs/database:
- CSRF blocks per day
- Rate limit hits per endpoint
- Failed auth attempts per user
- API usage by endpoint
- RLS permission denials
```

### Performance Impact:
```sql
-- Monitor after RLS enablement:
- Query execution time
- Database CPU usage
- API response times
- Page load times
```

---

## üö® Incident Response

### If Security Issues Occur:

#### 1. RLS Causing Issues:
```sql
-- Emergency disable (use only if critical):
ALTER TABLE public.accounts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.account_users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

#### 2. CSRF Blocking Legitimate Users:
```typescript
// Temporarily disable in affected endpoint:
// const csrfError = requireValidOrigin(request);
// if (csrfError) return csrfError;
```

#### 3. Rate Limiting Too Aggressive:
```typescript
// Adjust limits in /src/lib/rate-limit.ts:
const apiRateLimiter = new RateLimiter(60000, 100); // Increase from 60
```
