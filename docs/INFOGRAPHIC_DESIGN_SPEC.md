# The Prompt Page System - Animated Infographic Design Specification

## Core Concept
**A human-powered review creation system with multiple assistance tools** - The Prompt Page is the central hub where customers create reviews using various helper tools, with AI being one of several options.

## Title
**"The Prompt Page System"**
*Tagline: "Human-Powered Reviews with Smart Assistance"*

## Visual Metaphor
The system should be represented as a **collaborative workspace** where:
- The Prompt Page is the **central control panel**
- Review tools orbit around it like **satellites/modules**
- Energy flows between tools and the center
- The customer is in control of the entire process

## Key Requirements

### 1. Central Hub - The Prompt Page
- **Center of the system**: The main interface where customers write reviews
- Shows a stylized review form/text area
- All tools connect to this central hub
- **Visual**: Glassmorphic card with subtle glow, text cursor blinking

### 2. Review Helper Tools (Primary Circle)
Six tools arranged in a circle around the Prompt Page:

1. **Grammar Fix** - Polish & refine text
2. **Recent Reviews** - View examples from other customers  
3. **Kickstarter** - Conversation prompts to get started
4. **AI Generate** - Create review template using AI
5. **Friendly Note** - Add personal touches
6. **Special Offer** - Highlight deals/promotions

**Visual**: Each tool as a glowing node with:
- Icon representation
- Tool name
- Energy connection to central hub
- Pulse/glow when active

### 3. AI Generation Flow (Secondary Illustration)
**Positioned below** the main circle as a supplementary process:

#### Input Sources
- **Business Context** (left input)
  - Business info, services, brand voice
- **Prompt Page Data** (right input)  
  - Questions, responses, customer input

#### AI Processing
- Smaller, subdued visualization
- Shows how AI combines inputs to create template
- Not the main focus, just one tool among many

#### Output
- "Review Template" that feeds back up to main Prompt Page

**Visual**: Smaller scale, less prominent than main circle, supporting role

### 4. Customer Control Emphasis
- **Edit/Customize** indicators throughout
- Arrow showing customer can modify any generated content
- "Your Review, Your Way" messaging
- Visual cues that human is in control

### 5. Output Flow

#### Create → Copy → Post Process
- Three-step flow from the Prompt Page
- Shows the journey after review is complete
- Lightning or energy connectors between steps

#### Platform Distribution
Shows where reviews can be posted:
- Google
- Facebook
- Yelp
- TrustPilot
- DesignRush
- Many More

**Visual**: Platform cards as destinations receiving the final review

## Animation Sequence

### Phase 1: Tool Discovery
- Tools light up one by one around the Prompt Page
- Each tool briefly demonstrates its function
- Energy flows establish connections

### Phase 2: Active Creation
- Customer interaction with various tools
- Energy flows between selected tool and center
- Text appears/updates in central Prompt Page
- Multiple tools can be active

### Phase 3: Review Completion
- Final review pulses with completion
- Create → Copy → Post sequence activates
- Energy distributes to platform destinations
- 5 stars appear as success indicator

## Visual Style

### Layout Hierarchy
1. **Primary Focus**: Prompt Page + Tool Circle (60% of space)
2. **Secondary**: AI generation flow below (25% of space)
3. **Output**: Platform distribution (15% of space)

### Color Coding
- **Prompt Page**: Bright, welcoming gradient (blue to purple)
- **Human Tools**: Warm colors (green, yellow, orange)
- **AI Tool**: Cool tech color (cyan)
- **Energy Flows**: Matching tool colors
- **Background**: Dark with subtle grid pattern

### Effects
- **Glassmorphic** containers
- **Orbital motion** for tools (slow rotation)
- **Energy particles** flowing between connections
- **Pulse effects** on interaction
- **Glow effects** for active elements

## Key Messaging

### Main Points to Convey
1. **Human-Centered**: Customer is in control, tools assist
2. **Multiple Options**: 6 different ways to enhance reviews
3. **AI as Assistant**: AI is helpful but not dominant
4. **Flexibility**: Mix and match tools as needed
5. **Professional Output**: Results in 5-star reviews

### Text Labels
- "Choose Your Tools"
- "Human-Powered Creation"
- "AI-Assisted Options"
- "Edit & Customize"
- "Your Review, Your Way"

## Differentiators from Previous Concepts

1. **Human First**: Emphasizes human control over AI dominance
2. **Tool Equality**: AI is one of six equal tools, not the centerpiece
3. **Circular Layout**: Tools orbit the Prompt Page rather than linear flow
4. **Customer Agency**: Clear emphasis on editing and customization
5. **Collaborative Feel**: System assists rather than generates

## Success Criteria

The infographic succeeds when viewers understand:
1. The Prompt Page is a comprehensive review creation system
2. Customers have 6 different tools to help write reviews
3. AI is one helpful option among many
4. Humans maintain full control and can edit everything
5. The system supports posting to all major review platforms
6. The process is collaborative, not automated

## Animation Details

### Tool Interactions
- Hover/select a tool: It scales up, glows brighter
- Active tool: Energy beam connects to center
- Tool in use: Particles flow to/from Prompt Page
- Completion: Success pulse radiates outward

### Rotation Effect
- Tools slowly orbit around center (one full rotation per 30s)
- Creates dynamic feel without distraction
- Maintains visual interest during idle state

### Energy Flow Patterns
- **Human tools**: Warm, organic particle flows
- **AI tool**: Digital, structured data streams
- **Output flow**: Triumphant, spreading energy
