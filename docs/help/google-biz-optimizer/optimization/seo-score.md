# SEO Score Explained - Google Biz Optimizer™

## What is the SEO Score?

Your Google Business Profile SEO Score is a lightweight metric (0-10) that measures how complete and compelling your business description is. The score is generated directly from the information available in Google Biz Optimizer and focuses on improvements you can make without leaving the app.

## Score Breakdown

### Score Ranges
- **8-10:** Strong description — only fine-tuning needed
- **5-7:** Solid base — expand for better performance
- **0-4:** Missing essentials — invest in a richer description

## Key Factors in Your Score

### 1. Description Length
- Targets the 500-600 character sweet spot Google recommends
- Rewards detailed, customer-friendly copy

### 2. Business Name Mention
- Confirms your description reinforces brand recognition

### 3. Local Keywords
- Checks for city and state references that help customers understand where you serve

### 4. Category Alignment
- Looks for your primary category terms inside the description

### 5. Readability
- Encourages concise sentences (under ~20 words) so the copy is easy to scan

### 6. Clear Call to Action
- Rewards descriptions that tell customers how to take the next step (call, visit, book, etc.)

## How to Improve Your Score

### Quick Wins
1. **Expand your description** — aim for at least 500 characters without rambling
2. **Work in your business name naturally** to reinforce branding
3. **Mention your city and region** so customers know where you operate
4. **Reference your primary service** using the same words as your Google category
5. **Add a simple CTA** such as “Call us to schedule” or “Visit today”

### Continued Improvements
1. **Refresh copy each quarter** to keep it current
2. **Highlight new services or guarantees** as they launch
3. **Read it aloud** to confirm it flows like a conversation
4. **Link to fuller details on your site** for curious customers

## Industry-Specific Tips

### Restaurants
- Menu photos and links critical
- Dietary attributes (vegan, gluten-free)
- Reservation systems integration

### Professional Services
- Certifications and credentials
- Service area settings
- Appointment booking links

### Retail
- Product catalogs
- Shopping attributes
- In-store availability

## Common Mistakes That Hurt Score

1. **Thin descriptions** — fewer than 200 characters
2. **Skipping location mentions** — customers can’t tell where you serve
3. **Leaving out your main service** — generic copy helps no one
4. **Using long, complex sentences** — hard to read on mobile
5. **No call to action** — misses a chance to convert visitors

## How the Score Works

Google Biz Optimizer analyzes the text of your description and awards points for each of the six criteria above. The total is capped at 10 so you can quickly see whether you have the essentials covered or still need to expand.

## What a High Score Means

Higher scores indicate a complete, customer-friendly description. While Google determines rankings using many off-platform signals, a detailed description gives customers clarity and sets you up for stronger engagement.

## Monitoring Your Progress

- Check score weekly
- Track competitor changes
- Note algorithm updates
- Measure conversion impact

## Quick Win Strategy

Focus on the description updates that move the score most:
1. Expand to 2-3 short paragraphs that highlight what you do best
2. Name-drop your business and service area once each
3. Mention your flagship service with a benefits-focused sentence
4. Close with a clear call to action (call, book, visit, etc.)
