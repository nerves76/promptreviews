# Review Growth Trends - Google Biz Optimizer™

## What is Review Trend?

Your review trend shows the rate at which you're gaining new reviews compared to previous periods. It's a velocity metric that indicates momentum and business health.

## Why Review Velocity Matters

### Google's Freshness Factor
- Reviews from the **last 30 days** have 3x more ranking weight
- Steady review flow signals an active business
- Sudden drops can hurt local rankings
- Google prioritizes businesses with consistent recent reviews

### Customer Perception
- Recent reviews show current service quality
- Stale reviews (6+ months old) reduce trust by 40%
- Active review streams indicate a thriving business

## Understanding Your Trend

### Positive Trends (+%)
- **+10-25%:** Healthy growth
- **+25-50%:** Excellent momentum
- **+50%+:** Exceptional (verify authenticity)

### Negative Trends (-%)
- **-10%:** Normal fluctuation
- **-25%:** Needs attention
- **-50%+:** Critical - immediate action required

## Factors Affecting Review Trends

### Seasonal Patterns
- Retail: Peaks during holidays
- Restaurants: Weekend spikes
- Services: Post-project completion
- Tourism: Vacation seasons

### Business Changes
- New staff or management
- Service quality variations
- Marketing campaign effects
- Competition activity

## Maintaining Steady Growth

### 1. Set Review Targets
- **Minimum:** 1 review per week
- **Good:** 2-3 reviews per week
- **Excellent:** 1+ review daily

### 2. Create Systems
- Automated review invitations
- Staff incentive programs
- Follow-up sequences
- QR codes at point of sale

### 3. Monitor Consistently
- Weekly trend reviews
- Monthly goal assessments
- Quarterly strategy adjustments

## Review Velocity Benchmarks

| Business Size | Monthly Target | Warning Level |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Small (1-10 employees) | 4-8 reviews | <2 reviews |
| Medium (11-50) | 8-20 reviews | <4 reviews |
| Large (50+) | 20+ reviews | <10 reviews |

## Calculating Optimal Velocity

**Formula:** (Total Customers × 0.10) = Monthly review target

Example: 500 customers/month × 10% = 50 reviews target
