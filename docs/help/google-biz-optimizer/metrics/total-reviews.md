# Total Reviews - Google Biz Optimizerâ„¢

## What are Google Reviews?

Google Reviews are customer feedback posted directly on your Google Business Profile. They appear when people search for your business on Google Search or Maps, making them one of the most visible forms of social proof.

## Why Total Reviews Matter

- Fresh reviews (within 30 days) carry more weight

### Customer Trust
