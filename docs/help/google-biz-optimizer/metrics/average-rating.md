# Average Star Rating - Google Biz Optimizerâ„¢

## What is Average Rating?

Your average rating is the mean of all star ratings (1-5 stars) from customer reviews on your Google Business Profile. It's displayed prominently next to your business name in search results.

## The Psychology of Star Ratings

### Customer Decision Points
- **4.5+ stars:** Premium perception, customers expect excellence
- **4.0-4.4 stars:** Sweet spot - trustworthy and approachable
- **3.5-3.9 stars:** Customers hesitate, read reviews carefully
- **Below 3.5:** 68% of customers won't consider your business

### The Trust Factor
- Ratings between **4.2-4.5** are seen as most authentic
- Perfect 5.0 with many reviews can seem suspicious
- Mix of 4 and 5-star reviews appears most genuine

## Impact on Business

### Conversion Rates
- Moving from 3.5 to 4.0 stars: **+23% in conversions**
- Moving from 4.0 to 4.5 stars: **+17% in conversions**
- Each half-star increase: **5-9% revenue increase**

### Search Visibility
- Google shows star ratings in search results
- Higher ratings get more prominent placement
- Ratings affect click-through rates by up to 35%

## How to Improve Your Rating

### 1. Focus on Service Excellence
- Address common complaint themes
