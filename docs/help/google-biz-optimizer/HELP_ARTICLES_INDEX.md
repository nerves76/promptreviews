For adding help icons to components:

import { QuestionMarkCircleIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';

// In the component
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <span>Total Reviews</span>
  <button
    onClick={() => openHelp('metrics/total-reviews')}
    className="text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600 transition-colors"
    aria-label="Learn more about total reviews"
  >
    <QuestionMarkCircleIcon className="w-4 h-4" />
  </button>
</div>
```

## Content Guidelines

2. Include actionable tips
3. Show industry benchmarks

- "GBP optimization tips"
- "Local SEO [topic]"
- "Google My Business help"

## Notes

- Articles use markdown for flexibility
- Can be displayed in modals (embed) or full page (help center)
