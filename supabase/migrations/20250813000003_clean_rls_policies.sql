-- Clean up all RLS policies and start fresh
-- Date: 2025-08-13
--
-- Too many conflicting policies exist. This migration cleans them all
-- and creates a simple, working set of policies

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 1: DROP ALL EXISTING POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Drop all policies on accounts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can access all accounts" ON public.accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can create accounts" ON public.accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role has full access to accounts" ON public.accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create own account" ON public.accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own account" ON public.accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own account" ON public.accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own account" ON public.accounts;

-- Drop all policies on account_users  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for service role" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Owners can manage account users" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can access all account_users" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role has full access to account_users" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create own relationships" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own account_users" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own account_users" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own account_user records" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own account_users" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own relationships" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own account_user records" ON public.account_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own account_users" ON public.account_users;

-- Drop all policies on businesses
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable delete for users based on account_id" ON public.businesses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON public.businesses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON public.businesses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for users based on account_id" ON public.businesses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role has full access to businesses" ON public.businesses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own business profile" ON public.businesses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage businesses for owned accounts" ON public.businesses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own business profile" ON public.businesses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view businesses for their accounts" ON public.businesses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own business profile" ON public.businesses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own businesses" ON public.businesses;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 2: TEMPORARILY DISABLE RLS FOR AUTH ISSUES
-- =====================================================

-- For now, disable RLS until we can properly configure it
-- This is a temporary measure to unblock development

ALTER TABLE public.accounts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.account_users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.businesses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 3: CREATE SIMPLE POLICIES (DISABLED FOR NOW)
-- =====================================================

-- When we re-enable RLS, use these simple policies:

/*
-- ACCOUNTS: Simple policy - users can do everything with their own account
ALTER TABLE public.accounts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "accounts_all_authenticated"
ON public.accounts
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id OR auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id OR auth.uid() = user_id);

-- ACCOUNT_USERS: Simple policy - users can manage their relationships
ALTER TABLE public.account_users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "account_users_all_authenticated"
ON public.account_users
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id OR auth.uid() = account_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id OR auth.uid() = account_id);

-- BUSINESSES: Simple policy - users can manage businesses for their accounts
ALTER TABLE public.businesses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "businesses_all_authenticated"
ON public.businesses
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.account_users
    WHERE account_users.user_id = auth.uid()
    AND account_users.account_id = businesses.account_id
  )
)
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.account_users
    WHERE account_users.user_id = auth.uid()
    AND account_users.account_id = businesses.account_id
  )
);
*/

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 4: VERIFY STATUS
-- =====================================================

-- Check RLS status (should show disabled)
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('accounts', 'account_users', 'businesses');

-- =====================================================
-- NOTES
-- =====================================================

-- RLS has been temporarily disabled due to authentication issues.
-- The "Database error granting user" was caused by overly restrictive policies.
-- 
-- Next steps:
-- 1. Fix authentication flow to work with RLS
-- 2. Create proper service-role operations for account creation
-- 3. Re-enable RLS with simple, working policies
-- 4. Test thoroughly before production deployment
