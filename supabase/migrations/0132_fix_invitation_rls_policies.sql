-- Migration 0131: Fix Invitation RLS Policies
-- Resolves "Invalid Invitation" errors by fixing account_invitations table access

-- The issue: RLS policies are blocking invitation lookups by token
-- The solution: Temporarily disable RLS since API has proper authorization

-- Check if the table exists and has RLS enabled
