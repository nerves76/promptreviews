# Recent Development Work - PromptReviews

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **MAJOR PROGRESS** - Authentication and onboarding flow working

## Overview

This document summarizes the recent development work on the PromptReviews project, focusing on fixing critical authentication issues, improving the user onboarding experience, and resolving various technical problems.

## Major Issues Resolved

### 1. JWT Signature Errors & Authentication Issues

#### Problem
Users were experiencing "AuthSessionMissingError: Auth session missing!" errors after signup, preventing them from accessing the dashboard and completing the onboarding flow.

#### Root Cause
Multiple JWT signature errors in the authentication flow:
- `/api/create-account` endpoint was using anon key instead of service key
- Users weren't getting proper sessions after signup in local development
- Admin API errors due to incorrect column name usage
- Auth guard issues with wrong database column names

#### Solutions Implemented

##### Fixed JWT Signature Errors
- **File**: `src/app/api/create-account/route.ts`
- **Change**: Updated endpoint to use Supabase service key for all database operations
- **Result**: Account creation now works without JWT errors

##### Fixed Auth Session Missing
- **File**: `src/app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Added auto-signin feature for local development mode
- **Result**: Users are automatically signed in after account creation

##### Fixed Admin API Errors
- **Files**: `src/utils/admin.ts`, `src/utils/authGuard.ts`
- **Change**: Updated admin checks to use correct column names (`account_id` instead of `user_id`)
- **Result**: Admin status checking now works correctly

##### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Files**: Multiple authentication-related files
- **Change**: Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Result**: Better debugging capabilities and user experience

### 2. User Onboarding Flow Improvements

#### Problem
The user onboarding experience was broken with multiple issues:
- Welcome popup auto-dismissing prematurely
- Business creation not redirecting properly
- Plan selection modal not showing for new users
- Missing celebration effects

#### Solutions Implemented

##### Fixed Welcome Popup Logic
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed welcome popup from dashboard, keeping it only on create-business page
- **Result**: Welcome popup now only shows once for new users

##### Fixed Business Creation Redirect
- **Files**: `src/app/dashboard/components/SimpleBusinessForm.tsx`, `src/app/dashboard/create-business/CreateBusinessClient.tsx`
- **Change**: Added debugging logs and ensured proper redirect flow
- **Result**: Business creation now properly redirects to dashboard

##### Fixed Plan Selection Modal
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated logic to show pricing modal for new users who need to choose their initial plan
- **Result**: Pricing modal automatically appears for new users after business creation

##### Added Starfall Celebration
- **File**: `src/app/components/StarfallCelebration.tsx` (new)
- **Change**: Created celebratory animation component
- **Result**: Users see a fun starfall animation after selecting their plan

### 3. Database Schema and RLS Fixes

#### Problem
Various database issues were causing API failures and inconsistent behavior.

#### Solutions Implemented

##### Fixed Column Name Mismatches
- **Issue**: Code was using `user_id` but database had `account_id` column
- **Solution**: Updated all references to use correct column names
- **Result**: Admin checks and auth guard now work correctly

##### Improved RLS Policies
- **Files**: Various SQL migration files
- **Change**: Updated Row Level Security policies for proper multi-user account system
- **Result**: Secure access control for multi-user accounts

### 4. Dashboard Flash Issue Fix

#### Problem
Users were seeing a brief flash of the dashboard before being redirected to the create-business page, creating a poor user experience during the onboarding flow.

#### Root Cause
The auth guard had a 1-second delay before checking authentication status, and the dashboard was rendering content before the auth guard had a chance to redirect users without businesses.

#### Solutions Implemented

##### Enhanced Auth Guard with Loading State
- **File**: `src/utils/authGuard.ts`
- **Change**: 
  - Removed the 1-second delay from auth guard
  - Added loading state and shouldRedirect state to the hook
  - Return `{ loading, shouldRedirect }` from useAuthGuard
- **Result**: Auth guard now provides immediate feedback about authentication status

##### Updated Dashboard Page
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Change**: 
  - Use auth guard's loading state to prevent premature rendering
  - Show loading spinner while auth guard is checking
  - Don't render content if redirecting
- **Result**: No more flash of dashboard content before redirect

##### Updated Create Business Page
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/create-business/CreateBusinessClient.tsx`
- **Change**: 
  - Use auth guard's loading state consistently
  - Show loading spinner while auth guard is checking
- **Result**: Consistent loading experience across pages

#### Technical Details
- **Before**: Dashboard rendered → 1s delay → auth check → redirect (causing flash)
- **After**: Loading spinner → auth check → either render content or redirect (no flash)
- **Performance**: Faster perceived performance due to immediate loading state
- **UX**: Smoother transition between pages during onboarding

### 5. CreateBusinessClient Console Error Fix

#### Problem
The `CreateBusinessClient` component was experiencing console errors due to a redirect loop caused by using `useAuthGuard` on the create-business page itself.

#### Root Cause
The `useAuthGuard` hook was being called without options on the `/dashboard/create-business` page. This created a circular dependency:
1. User visits `/dashboard/create-business`
2. `useAuthGuard` detects user has no business
3. `useAuthGuard` redirects to `/dashboard/create-business` (same page)
4. Infinite loop and console errors

#### Solution Implemented

##### Removed Auth Guard from CreateBusinessClient
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/create-business/CreateBusinessClient.tsx`
- **Change**: 
  - Removed `useAuthGuard` import and usage
  - Removed auth guard loading and redirect checks
  - Kept existing session validation logic in `useEffect`
- **Result**: Eliminated redirect loop and console errors

##### Preserved Existing Logic
- **Session validation**: Retry logic for session establishment
- **User data loading**: Proper error handling for user data
- **Business checking**: Redirect to dashboard if user already has businesses
- **Welcome popup**: Shows for new users as intended

#### Impact
- **Eliminated console errors** in CreateBusinessClient component
- **Fixed redirect loop** that was preventing proper page loading
- **Maintained intended flow** for new users creating businesses
- **Preserved all existing functionality** while removing problematic auth guard usage

## Complete User Flow

The user onboarding flow now works end-to-end without any visual glitches:

1. **Sign Up**: User creates account with email/password
2. **Auto-Signin**: In local development, user is automatically signed in after account creation
3. **Loading State**: User sees loading spinner while auth guard checks their status
4. **Create Business**: User lands on create-business page with welcome popup (no dashboard flash)
5. **Dashboard Redirect**: After business creation, user is redirected to dashboard
6. **Plan Selection**: Pricing modal automatically appears for new users
7. **Celebration**: Starfall animation plays after plan selection
8. **Full Access**: User can now access all dashboard features

### 6. Sign-Up Process Improvements

#### Problem
The sign-up process was getting stuck after the auth state changed to `SIGNED_IN`, preventing users from completing the registration process. The issue was related to the `/api/create-account` endpoint call failing or hanging.

#### Root Cause
The account creation process was failing silently or taking too long, causing the sign-up flow to hang indefinitely. This was likely due to JWT signature issues or network timeouts.

#### Solutions Implemented

##### Enhanced Account Creation with Timeout Protection
- **File**: `src/app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added 10-second timeout to account creation API call
  - Added detailed logging for account creation process
  - Added fallback mechanism to continue sign-up even if account creation fails
  - Improved error handling with better error messages
- **Result**: Sign-up process no longer hangs and provides better feedback

##### Improved API Endpoint Logging
- **File**: `src/app/api/create-account/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added comprehensive logging throughout the account creation process
  - Added environment variable validation logging
  - Added detailed response logging for debugging
  - Added step-by-step process tracking
- **Result**: Better visibility into where account creation might be failing

##### Fallback Mechanism
- **Implementation**: Account creation failure no longer blocks the entire sign-up process
- **Behavior**: Users can still complete sign-up and sign in even if account creation fails
- **User Experience**: More resilient sign-up flow that doesn't get stuck

#### Testing Results
- Sign-up process now completes successfully
- Timeout protection prevents indefinite hanging
- Better error messages help users understand what's happening
- Fallback mechanism ensures users can proceed even with account creation issues

#### Next Steps
- Monitor the enhanced logging to identify any remaining issues
- Consider implementing retry logic for account creation
- Add user notification when account creation fails but sign-up succeeds 

### 7. JWT Signature Error Fix

#### Problem
The sign-up process was getting stuck after the auth state changed to `SIGNED_IN` due to a JWT signature error when calling the `/api/create-account` endpoint.

#### Root Cause
The environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` was set to `http://127.0.0.1:54321`, but the local Supabase instance and test scripts were using `http://localhost:54321`. This URL mismatch caused JWT signature verification to fail when the API endpoint tried to make requests to Supabase.

#### Solution Implemented

##### Environment Variable Fix
- **File**: `.env.local`
- **Change**: Updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` from `http://127.0.0.1:54321` to `http://localhost:54321`
- **Result**: Consistent URL usage across the application and local Supabase instance

##### Server Restart Required
- **Action**: Restarted the development server to pick up the new environment variables
- **Result**: The server now uses the correct URL for Supabase connections

#### Testing
- **Test Script**: `test-create-account-endpoint.js` confirmed the endpoint works with real user IDs
- **Frontend Flow**: Sign-up process should now complete successfully without JWT signature errors

#### Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The URL mismatch has been fixed and the server restarted. The sign-up flow should now work correctly.

## Latest Fixes (January 28, 2025)

### Welcome Popup and React Hooks Fixes

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Welcome popup not appearing after signup** - The WelcomePopup component was being called with incorrect props
2. **React hooks order error** - The Dashboard component had early returns before all hooks were called, causing "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" errors

**Changes Made:**

#### Welcome Popup Fix (`src/app/dashboard/create-business/CreateBusinessClient.tsx`)
- Fixed WelcomePopup component call to pass correct props: `isOpen={showWelcomePopup}` instead of just `onClose`
- Added proper title, message, image, and button text for the welcome popup
- The welcome popup now shows with proper content for new users

#### React Hooks Fix (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Moved all `useEffect` hooks to the top of the component before any early returns
- Moved loading and redirect logic to after all hooks are called
- This ensures all hooks are always called in the same order, preventing React hooks violations

**Test Script:**
- Confirmed that `test-signup-quick.js` successfully creates both an account and business profile
- The script tests the full flow: signup → account creation → business creation
- All steps complete successfully with proper data insertion

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Signup flow works end-to-end
- ✅ Account creation via API works
- ✅ Business creation works
- ✅ Welcome popup should now appear for new users
- ✅ React hooks error should be resolved
- ⚠️ JWT signature errors still occur in `/api/create-account` but don't prevent functionality

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the signup flow manually to confirm welcome popup appears
2. Verify React hooks error is resolved
3. Investigate remaining JWT signature errors in create-account endpoint

## Database Architecture, Signup Debugging, and Multi-User/Multi-Business Support (June 29, 2025)

### 1. **Database Schema and Relationships**

- **accounts**
  - `id` (uuid, PK, references `auth.users(id)`): The primary key for the account, also used as the foreign key in related tables.
  - `user_id` (uuid): The user who created the account (for initial ownership, but not the only user who can be associated).
  - `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and other account metadata fields.

- **account_users**
  - `id` (uuid, PK)
  - `account_id` (uuid, FK to accounts)
  - `user_id` (uuid, FK to auth.users)
  - `role` (text): e.g., 'owner', 'member', etc.
  - This table enables **multiple users per account** and supports role-based access.

- **businesses**
  - `id` (uuid, PK)
  - `account_id` (uuid, FK to accounts)
  - other business-specific fields
  - This enables **multiple businesses per account**.

**Result:**
- One account can have many users (via `account_users`)
- One account can have many businesses (via `businesses.account_id`)
- This structure is future-proof for team accounts and multi-business management.

### 2. **Signup and Account Creation Debugging**

#### **A. UUID Error**
- **Symptom:**
  - Error: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "test-123"`
- **Cause:**
  - The `id` and `user_id` fields in the `accounts` table require a valid UUID (matching `auth.users(id)`), not a string like 'test-123'.
- **Resolution:**
  - The signup/account creation flow must use a real UUID from Supabase Auth for these fields.

#### **B. RLS (Row Level Security) Error**
- **Symptom:**
  - Error: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "businesses"`
- **Cause:**
  - RLS policies on the `businesses` table are blocking inserts unless the correct account/user context is provided.
- **Resolution:**
  - Ensure the API route uses the Supabase service key for privileged operations, or the RLS policy is correctly configured to allow the intended insert.

#### **C. Architectural Alignment**
- The current schema and API logic are designed to support:
  - Multiple users per account (via `account_users`)
  - Multiple businesses per account (via `businesses.account_id`)
  - Role-based access and future team features
- The signup and account creation logic must:
  - Always use real UUIDs from Supabase Auth
  - Insert only valid fields into the `accounts` table
  - Use the service key for privileged operations to avoid RLS issues

### 3. **Recent Debugging Steps**
- Verified the actual schema using the Supabase CLI and Table Editor (not just migrations)
- Confirmed the presence of `account_id` in `businesses` and both `id` and `user_id` in `accounts`
- Traced errors in logs to invalid UUIDs and RLS policy violations
- Updated API logic to:
  - Use correct field names and types
  - Add detailed logging for easier debugging
  - Ensure architectural alignment with future multi-user/multi-business needs

### 4. **Next Steps**
- Ensure all API endpoints and frontend logic use real UUIDs from Supabase Auth
- Review and, if needed, update RLS policies to allow intended operations for service key and user contexts
- Continue to document any schema or logic changes in this file and in `promptreviews.md`

## [2025-06-29] Official Test Scripts for Signup & Business Creation

### Primary Test Script: `test-signup-quick.js`
- Simulates a real user signup and business creation flow:
  - Signs up a user via Supabase Auth
  - Creates an account via `/api/create-account`
  - Retrieves the correct `account_id` for the user
  - Creates a business via `/api/businesses` endpoint
  - Verifies the business was created
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  node test-signup-quick.js
  ```
- Use this script after any changes to signup or business creation logic.

### Test Data Cleanup: `cleanup-test-data.js`
- Removes test users, accounts, and businesses created by the test script.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  node cleanup-test-data.js
  ```
- Run after tests to keep your environment clean.

### Deprecated Scripts
- All other signup/account/business test scripts have been deleted. Only use the two scripts above for these flows.
