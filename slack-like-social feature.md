## 1. Overview

The goal is to provide a lightweight community space for users to share posts, comment, and reactâ€”without the complexity of direct messaging, deep threads, or image previews.  
Users will have clear identities (first name + business) but unique, non-guessable handles. Users do not need to participate if they don't want to.
