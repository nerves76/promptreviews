# Billing Period Implementation Test Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250811000001_add_billing_period_to_accounts.sql`
- Added `billing_period` column to accounts table
- Check constraint: only 'monthly' or 'annual' values
- Default: 'monthly'
- Index for performance

### 2. API Endpoints Updated

#### `/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts`
- Accepts `billingPeriod` parameter
- Uses correct price ID: `PRICE_IDS[plan][billingPeriod]`
- Supports both monthly and annual prices

#### `/api/upgrade-subscription/route.ts`
- Handles billing period changes for existing customers
- Updates both `plan` and `billing_period` in database
- Applies Stripe proration automatically

#### `/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts`
- Extracts billing period from `subscription.items.data[0].price.recurring.interval`
- Stores as 'annual' if interval === 'year', otherwise 'monthly'
- Updates database on subscription events

### 3. UI Components

#### Plan Page (`/dashboard/plan/page.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Billing toggle (Monthly/Annual) with "Save 15%" badge
- Button text changes based on selection:
  - "Current Plan" when matching current plan/billing
  - "Switch to Annual" when same plan, different billing
  - "Switch to Monthly" when same plan, different billing
  - "Upgrade/Downgrade" for plan changes
- Confirmation dialog for billing period changes
- Loading overlay during processing
- Header shows current billing period

#### Account Page (`/dashboard/account/page.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Shows billing period badge next to plan name
- "View Plans" / "Change Plan" button
- "Manage Billing & Payment" button (disabled for free plans)

### 4. Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Monthly → Annual (Same Plan)
```javascript
Current: Builder Monthly
Action: Click Builder with Annual toggle
Result: 
- Button shows "Switch to Annual"
- Confirm dialog: "Switch to annual billing and save 15%?"
- Proration applied immediately
```

#### Scenario 2: Annual → Monthly (Same Plan)
```javascript
Current: Builder Annual
Action: Click Builder with Monthly toggle
Result:
- Button shows "Switch to Monthly"
- Confirm dialog: "Switch to monthly billing? You'll lose the 15% annual discount."
- Credit applied for unused time
```

#### Scenario 3: Plan Upgrade with Billing Change
```javascript
Current: Builder Monthly
Action: Click Maven with Annual toggle
Result:
- Button shows "Upgrade"
- Upgrade modal appears
- Can select annual billing during upgrade
```

### 5. Stripe Integration

#### Customer Portal
Users can also change billing periods through Stripe's Customer Portal by:
1. Click "Manage Billing & Payment" on Account page
2. Redirected to Stripe portal
3. Can switch between monthly/annual prices
4. Changes sync back via webhook

#### Proration Handling
- **Monthly → Annual:** Charged prorated amount for rest of year
- **Annual → Monthly:** Credit for unused time applied to future bills
- Handled automatically by Stripe with `proration_behavior: "always_invoice"`

### 6. Environment Variables Required
```env
# Monthly prices (existing)
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_GROWER=price_xxx
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_BUILDER=price_xxx
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MAVEN=price_xxx

# Annual prices (new)
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_GROWER_ANNUAL=price_xxx
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_BUILDER_ANNUAL=price_xxx
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MAVEN_ANNUAL=price_xxx
```
