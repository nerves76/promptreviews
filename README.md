## Local Development

### Database Setup

**Important**: This application uses the **production Supabase database** for all environments (local and production). We do not use a local database instance.

### Email Confirmation Bypass

For local development convenience, we've implemented an email confirmation bypass:

- **Local Development** (`localhost:3001`): Users can sign in immediately after account creation
- **Production** (`app.promptreviews.app`): Normal email confirmation flow

The bypass is automatically detected based on the hostname and provides a user-friendly message explaining the behavior.

### Running Locally

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Local: http://localhost:3001
   - Network: http://192.168.x.x:3001

### Testing User Accounts

For local development testing:
1. Create a new account using the sign-up form
2. Sign in immediately (no email confirmation required)
3. Test all features with the created account

For detailed local development information, see [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](./LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Automatic Trial Reminder System

This project includes an automated trial reminder system that sends emails to users whose trial expires in 3 days.

### Features
- ‚úÖ **Automatic daily scheduling** via Vercel cron jobs
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate prevention** - max 1 reminder per day per user
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging** of all reminder attempts
- ‚úÖ **Manual override** capability for testing
- ‚úÖ **Admin dashboard** for monitoring and management
- ‚úÖ **Error tracking** and reporting

### Setup

1. **Database Setup**: Run the SQL script in `create_trial_reminder_logs.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Environment Variables**: Add `CRON_SECRET_TOKEN` to your environment variables
3. **Vercel Deployment**: The cron job is automatically configured in `vercel.json`

### How It Works

- **Schedule**: Runs daily at 9 AM UTC via Vercel cron
- **Target Users**: Users on 'grower' plan with trial ending in 3 days
- **Email Template**: Uses the 'trial_reminder' email template
- **Logging**: All attempts are logged in `trial_reminder_logs` table
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing reminders sent today

### Admin Management

- **Manual Sending**: Use the "Send Trial Reminders" button in Email Templates section
- **Logs Viewing**: Visit `/admin/trial-reminders` to view all reminder activity
- **Statistics**: See total, successful, failed, and today's reminder counts
- **Error Tracking**: View detailed error messages for failed reminders

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/cron/send-trial-reminders` - Automated cron endpoint (requires `CRON_SECRET_TOKEN`)
- `POST /api/send-trial-reminders` - Manual sending endpoint (requires admin access)

### Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive monitoring:
- Real-time statistics in admin dashboard
- Detailed logs with success/failure tracking

## Recent Fixes (Latest Update)

### Added Google Analytics 4 Integration
- **Feature**: Comprehensive user behavior tracking
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added GA4 tracking script to root layout
  - Created analytics utility functions for event tracking
  - Integrated tracking across all major user interactions
  - Added admin action tracking for content management
  - Implemented error tracking integration with Sentry
- **Events Tracked**: User auth, widget interactions, business actions, admin actions, navigation, errors
- **Privacy**: No PII sent to GA4, GDPR/CCPA compliant

### Fixed Widget Rendering Issues
- **Issue**: Widget was not rendering due to dependency loading failures
- **Root Cause**: Swiper CDN loading issues and complex dependency management
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `widget-embed-working.js` with smart fallback system
  - Widget tries Swiper first, falls back to grid layout if it fails
  - All styles are inline - no external CSS dependencies
  - Always renders something useful, never fails completely

### Fixed Infinite Loop in Test Page
- **Issue**: Test page was showing infinite "Test page loaded" messages in debug console
- **Root Cause**: Conflict between automatic widget initialization and manual test data rendering
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed test page container ID from `promptreviews-widget` to `test-widget-container`
  - This prevents the widget script's automatic initialization from conflicting with manual test rendering
  - Test page now uses dedicated container that bypasses automatic API calls

### Fixed "Element type is invalid" Error
- **Issue**: Application was crashing with "Element type is invalid" error due to conflicting type definitions
- **Root Cause**: Multiple `WidgetData` and `DesignState` interfaces were defined in different files, causing import conflicts
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed `MultiWidget.tsx` to import types from local `./index` file instead of `../../shared/types`
  - Fixed `SingleWidget.tsx` to use consistent type definitions
  - Simplified widget components to avoid complex type transformations
  - Restored `ConsoleLogger.tsx` component that was accidentally cleared

### Font System Optimization
- **Issue**: Layout was loading 30+ fonts but only using 6 in widget styling
- **Solution**: 
  - Restored all Google Fonts needed for prompt page styling (30+ fonts)
  - Maintained widget styling fonts (6 fonts: Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat, Poppins)
  - Kept system fonts separate (no import needed)

### Test Page Access
- **Issue**: Test pages were being accessed with incorrect URLs (`/public/widgets/...`)
- **Solution**: 
  - Correct URL format: `/widgets/multi/test-multiple.html` (without `/public` prefix)
  - Static files in `/public` directory are served from root URL

## Working Test Pages

### 1. Working Widget Test (Recommended)
**URL**: `http://localhost:3001/widgets/multi/working-test.html`
- **Features**: Full Swiper carousel with navigation arrows and pagination
- **Fallback**: Automatically falls back to grid layout if Swiper fails
- **Responsive**: 3 cards on desktop ‚Üí 2 on tablet ‚Üí 1 on mobile
- **Script**: Uses `widget-embed-working.js` (most reliable)

### 2. Ultra Simple Test
**URL**: `http://localhost:3001/widgets/multi/ultra-simple-test.html`
- **Features**: Simple grid layout, no external dependencies
- **Use Case**: Basic testing when you need guaranteed rendering
- **Script**: Self-contained, no external scripts

### 3. Original Test (Legacy)
**URL**: `http://localhost:3001/widgets/multi/test-embed.html`
- **Features**: Original widget script with Swiper
- **Status**: May have dependency issues, use working-test.html instead
- **Script**: Uses `widget-embed.js` (original version)

## Widget Scripts

### widget-embed-working.js (Recommended)
- **Smart fallback system**: Tries Swiper, falls back to grid
- **All inline styles**: No external CSS dependencies
- **Better error handling**: Detailed logging and timeout protection
- **Always renders**: Never fails completely

### widget-embed.js (Legacy)
- **Original implementation**: Complex dependency loading
- **External CSS**: Requires `multi-widget.css`
- **May fail**: Can get stuck in loading state

   ```typescript
   interface WidgetProps {
     reviews: Review[];
     design: DesignState;
     onDesignChange?: (design: DesignState) => void;
   }
   ```

2. **Design State**
   ```typescript
   interface DesignState {
     colors: {
       primary: string;
       secondary: string;
       text: string;
     };
     typography: {
       fontFamily: string;
       fontSize: string;
     };
     layout: {
       padding: string;
       borderRadius: string;
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Review Data**
   ```typescript
   interface Review {
     id: string;
     author: string;
     content: string;
     star_rating: number;
     photo_url?: string;
     created_at: string;
   }
   ```

## Deployment

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Widget-Embed Folder**

   - Not intended for dashboard functionality
   - Keep widget-specific code in dashboard components

2. **Star Rating System**
   - Use the shared `StarRating` component
   - Maintain consistent styling across widgets
   - Support half-star ratings

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize image loading
   - Implement lazy loading for widgets
   - Cache design settings

4. **Security**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize review content
   - Secure photo uploads

## Troubleshooting

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3001
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

2. **Build Cache Issues**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

## [2024-06-08] Dashboard Widget Preview: Swiper Global Loading Fix

- The dashboard widget preview now waits for the Swiper script to be available globally (`window.Swiper`) before rendering the vanilla JS multi-widget.
- This ensures that design changes (such as color) made in the editor are reflected live in the widget preview.
- Previously, if Swiper was not available on the global scope, the widget would not update visually after design changes.
- This fix resolves the issue and improves reliability of the live preview.

Last updated: March 19, 2024

   - Moved console.log to useEffect to prevent render-time state updates

3. **Created test pages**:
   - `public/widgets/multi/test-responsive.html` for isolated widget testing
   - `public/widgets/multi/test-submit-button.html` for submit button visibility testing

4. **Fixed submit review button visibility** in `public/widgets/multi/multi-widget.css`:
   - Increased container heights and padding
   - Added proper overflow handling
   - Enhanced button container spacing
   - Improved responsive behavior

### Testing Widget Responsiveness
You can test the widget responsiveness independently by visiting:
```
http://localhost:3001/widgets/multi/test-responsive.html
```

This page provides a slider to adjust widget width and test the responsive behavior without the complexity of the full dashboard. 

## Account Sign-Up Flow

- When a user signs up, they will receive a confirmation email.
- The user must click the confirmation link in their email to activate their account before signing in.
- This process improves security, prevents spam, and ensures account recovery.

# PromptReviews - Local Development Setup

## Current Status

This project is transitioning from a production Supabase instance to a local Supabase instance for development. The application is a Next.js-based review management system with Supabase as the backend.

## Environment Configuration

### .env.local File
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Correctly configured
- **Local Supabase URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:54321`
- **Local Supabase Anon Key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJleHAiOjE5ODM4MTI5OTZ9.CRXP1A7WOeoJeXxjNni43kdQwgnWNReilDMblYTn_I0`
- **Local Supabase Service Key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImV4cCI6MTk4MzgxMjk5Nn0.EGIM96RAZx35lJzdJsyH-qQwv8Hdp7fsn3W0YpN81IU`
- **Verification**: Values match `supabase status` output
- **Loading**: Server loads `.env.local` on startup (confirmed by logs: `Reload env: .env.local`)

### Server Environment
- **Next.js Server**: Running on port 3001
- **Environment Loading**: ‚úÖ Server loads `.env.local` correctly
- **Cache Management**: `.next` build cache cleared after environment changes
- **Restart Protocol**: Server fully stopped and restarted after every environment change

## Supabase Local Instance

### Status
- **Running**: ‚úÖ Supabase is running locally
- **API URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:54321` (accessible)
- **Studio URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:54323` (accessible)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL running on port 54322

### Database State
- **Migrations**: All migrations applied successfully
- **Schema**: Complete schema with all tables created
- **Users**: Currently empty (after recent reset)
- **Accounts**: Currently empty (after recent reset)

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### 1. JWT Signature Error
**Error**: `JWSError JWSInvalidSignature` when calling `/api/create-account`

**Root Cause**: JWT token being sent to Supabase does not match the expected signature for the local instance.

**Possible Causes**:
- User logged in with a JWT from a different Supabase instance (e.g., production)
- Browser session contains stale authentication data
- JWT token format mismatch between local and production instances

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Clear browser storage and cache completely
2. Sign out from any existing sessions
3. Clear localStorage and sessionStorage
4. Try in incognito/private browsing mode
5. Verify no cached authentication tokens exist

### 2. Browser/Cache Issues
**Status**: ‚úÖ Tested across multiple browsers
- **Safari**: Tested
- **Chrome**: Tested
- **Incognito Mode**: Tested
- **Cache Clearing**: Completed

**Result**: Error persists across browsers, confirming it's not a browser cache issue.

### 3. Test/Debug Files
**Status**: ‚úÖ Cleaned up
- All test scripts deleted
- Sentry test page removed
- No hardcoded test data remains
- No `"test-user-123"` references in codebase

### 4. Frontend Code
**Status**: ‚úÖ Correctly configured
- Sign-up form uses correct user ID from Supabase Auth
- No hardcoded user IDs
- API calls use proper authentication flow

## Current Database State

### Users Table
- **Location**: `auth.users` (Supabase Auth schema)
- **Current State**: Empty (after recent reset)
- **Expected**: Should contain users after successful sign-up

### Accounts Table
- **Location**: `public.accounts`
- **Current State**: Empty (after recent reset)
- **Expected**: Should contain account records after successful sign-up

### Account Users Table
- **Location**: `public.account_users`
- **Purpose**: Links users to accounts
- **Current State**: Empty (after recent reset)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Clear All Authentication State**
   - Sign out from any existing sessions
   - Clear browser storage completely
   - Restart browser

2. **Test Sign-up Flow**
   - Attempt to create a new user account
   - Monitor for JWT signature errors
   - Check if user appears in `auth.users` table

3. **Verify Database State**
   - Check if user is created in `auth.users`
   - Check if account is created in `public.accounts`
   - Check if user-account link is created in `public.account_users`

### If JWT Error Persists
1. **Check Supabase Configuration**
   - Verify JWT secret in `supabase/config.toml`
   - Consider regenerating local Supabase instance
   - Check for any custom JWT configuration

2. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Use different browser profile
   - Test with fresh Supabase instance
   - Verify no environment variable conflicts

## Development Commands

### Start Local Development
```bash
# Start Supabase
supabase start

# Start Next.js server
npm run dev

# Check Supabase status
supabase status
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Reset database (applies all migrations)
supabase db reset

# Check database schema
supabase db diff

# View logs
supabase logs
```

### Environment Verification
```bash
# Check environment variables
cat .env.local

# Verify Supabase keys match
supabase status
```

## Architecture Overview

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up via Supabase Auth
2. User record created in `auth.users`
3. Account created in `public.accounts`
4. User linked to account in `public.account_users`
5. JWT token issued for authenticated requests

### API Endpoints
- `/api/create-account`: Creates account and links user
- `/api/auth/*`: Supabase Auth endpoints
- `/api/widgets/*`: Widget management endpoints

### Database Schema
- **auth.users**: Supabase Auth user records
- **public.accounts**: Business accounts
- **public.account_users**: User-account relationships
- **public.businesses**: Business profiles
- **public.contacts**: Contact management
- **public.review_submissions**: Review data

# Automated Signup & Business Creation Testing

## Primary Test Script: `test-signup-quick.js`

This script is the **official and only supported tool** for end-to-end testing of the signup and business creation flow. It simulates a real user by:
- Creating a user via Supabase Auth
- Creating an account via the `/api/create-account` endpoint
- Retrieving the correct `account_id` for the user
- Creating a business via the `/api/businesses` endpoint (not a direct DB insert)
- Verifying the business was created in the database

**Usage:**
```bash
node test-signup-quick.js
```

- The script prints a summary with all relevant IDs and emails for easy reference and cleanup.
- If any step fails, the script will exit with an error and log details for debugging.

**Best Practices:**
- Run this script after making changes to the signup or business creation flow to ensure everything works as expected.
- Use the cleanup script below to remove test data after testing.

---

## Test Data Cleanup: `cleanup-test-data.js`

This script removes test data created by the test script. It can clean up specific test data or all test data based on patterns.

**Usage:**
```bash
node cleanup-test-data.js
```

- By default, it will remove all test users, accounts, and businesses matching the test patterns (e.g., emails starting with `test-`).
- You can also pass a specific email to clean up a single test user and their data.

**Best Practices:**
- Always run this script after running tests to keep your development and test environments clean.
- Review the script before running in production environments.

---

## Deprecated Test Scripts

All previous test scripts for signup, account, or business creation have been deleted. Only use the scripts above for testing these flows.

- ‚úÖ **Automatic task completion** when users visit key pages
- ‚úÖ **Persistent progress** across sessions and page refreshes
- ‚úÖ **Real-time status updates** in the UI
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- ‚úÖ **Multi-user support** compatible with account architecture

### Task Types

The system tracks completion of these key onboarding tasks:

- **Business Profile Created** (`business_profile_created`)
  - Automatically completes when user visits `/dashboard/business-profile`
  - Tracks business information setup

- **Style Configured** (`style_configured`)
  - Automatically completes when user visits `/dashboard/style`
  - Tracks branding and design preferences

  - Automatically completes when user visits `/dashboard/create-prompt-page`
  - Tracks first prompt page creation

- **Widget Configured** (`widget_configured`)
  - Automatically completes when user visits `/dashboard/widget`
  - Tracks widget setup and configuration

- **Contacts Uploaded** (`contacts_uploaded`)
  - Automatically completes when user visits `/dashboard/contacts`
  - Tracks contact list management

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE onboarding_tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  task_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, task_key)
);
```

#### Utility Functions
- `getOnboardingTasks(userId)` - Fetch all tasks for a user
- `markTaskComplete(userId, taskKey)` - Mark a specific task as complete
- `initializeUserTasks(userId)` - Create default task records for new users

#### Component Integration
- **GettingStarted Component**: Displays task completion status from database
- **Dashboard Pages**: Pass user ID to enable automatic task completion
- **Error Recovery**: Falls back to local state if database is unavailable

### Usage

The onboarding tasks system is automatically integrated into the user experience:

1. **New Users**: Task records are created when users first access the dashboard
2. **Progress Tracking**: The GettingStarted component shows real-time completion status
3. **Automatic Completion**: Tasks complete when users visit relevant pages
4. **Persistent Storage**: Progress is saved to database and persists across sessions

### Security

- **RLS Policies**: Users can only access their own task records
- **Input Validation**: All task keys are validated against allowed values
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks prevent system failures
