## Local Development

### Database Setup

**Important**: This application uses the **production Supabase database** for all environments (local and production). We do not use a local database instance.

### Email Confirmation Bypass

For local development convenience, we've implemented an email confirmation bypass:

- **Local Development** (`localhost:3002`): Users can sign in immediately after account creation
- **Production** (`app.promptreviews.app`): Normal email confirmation flow

The bypass is automatically detected based on the hostname and provides a user-friendly message explaining the behavior.

### Running Locally

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Local: http://localhost:3002
   - Network: http://192.168.x.x:3002

### Testing User Accounts

For local development testing:
1. Create a new account using the sign-up form
2. Sign in immediately (no email confirmation required)
3. Test all features with the created account

### Development Authentication Bypass System

For rapid development and debugging, we've implemented a comprehensive authentication bypass system that allows you to skip the normal authentication flow while maintaining full access to all features.

#### Enabling the Bypass

To enable the development authentication bypass:

1. **Open your browser's developer console**
2. **Run the enable script:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem("dev_auth_bypass", "true");
   window.location.reload();
   ```

3. **Or use the convenience script:**
   ```bash
   node enable-dev-login.js
   ```

#### What the Bypass Does

When enabled, the system:
- **Bypasses all authentication checks** in development mode
- **Uses a pre-existing test account** (`test@example.com` / ID: `12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789012`)
- **Provides full dashboard access** without requiring sign-in
- **Enables business creation and management** using the test account
- **Allows prompt page access** without business profile validation errors

#### Architecture Overview

The bypass system works by intercepting authentication calls at multiple levels:

##### Frontend Authentication Bypass
- **AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`): Mock user session creation
- **DashboardLayout** (`src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`): Skip sign-in redirects
- **AuthGuard** (`src/utils/authGuard.ts`): Mock authentication state
- **Account Selection** (`src/utils/accountSelectionHooks.ts`): Mock account data

##### Database Access Bypass
Due to Row Level Security (RLS) policies requiring `auth.uid()`, the frontend client cannot access certain tables in development mode. The bypass system routes these operations through API endpoints that use the service role client:

- **Business Operations**: `/api/businesses` (GET/POST) - Bypasses RLS for business CRUD
- **Onboarding Tasks**: `/api/onboarding-tasks` (GET/POST) - Bypasses RLS for task management

##### Files Modified for Bypass Support

**Core Authentication:**
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Mock user session
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Skip auth redirects
- `src/utils/authGuard.ts` - Mock auth state
- `src/utils/accountSelectionHooks.ts` - Mock account selection
- `src/utils/supabaseClient.ts` - `getUserOrMock()` helper
- `src/utils/accountUtils.ts` - Mock account lookups

**API Endpoints (Service Role):**
- `src/app/api/businesses/route.ts` - Business CRUD with RLS bypass
- `src/app/api/onboarding-tasks/route.ts` - Task management with RLS bypass

**Frontend Components:**
- `src/app/prompt-pages/page.tsx` - API-based business fetching
- `src/app/dashboard/business-profile/page.tsx` - API-based business fetching
- `src/app/dashboard/create-business/CreateBusinessClient.tsx` - Use mock user
- `src/utils/onboardingTasks.ts` - API-based task operations

#### Development Account Details

The bypass uses an existing account in the database:
- **User ID**: `12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789012`
- **Email**: `test@example.com`
- **Account ID**: `12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789012` (same as user ID)
- **Name**: Dev User
- **Business**: Can create/manage businesses under this account

#### Disabling the Bypass

To return to normal authentication:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem("dev_auth_bypass");
window.location.reload();
```

#### Security Notes

- **Development Only**: The bypass only works when `NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- **Local Storage Gated**: Requires explicit localStorage flag to activate
- **No Production Impact**: All bypass code is development-mode conditional
- **Service Role Separation**: API bypasses use separate service role client, not user client

This system allows for rapid development and testing without the overhead of managing authentication flows, while maintaining the security and integrity of the production authentication system.

### Development Server Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues starting the development server:

1. **Port 3002 Already in Use**:
   ```bash
   # Kill existing processes on port 3002
   lsof -ti:3002 | xargs kill -9
   
   # Or restart the server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Sentry Integration Errors**:
   ```bash
   # Disable Sentry for local development
   DISABLE_SENTRY=true npm run dev
   ```

3. **Database Migration Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check migration status
   npm run check-migrations
   
   # Apply missing migrations
   supabase db push
   ```

4. **Test Data Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   # Clear test data from database
   node clear-database.js
   ```

### Development Best Practices

- **Use `DISABLE_SENTRY=true`** for local development to reduce noise
- **Check migrations** before starting development server
- **Clear test data** regularly to maintain clean development environment
- **Monitor console logs** for API errors and debugging information
- **Test sign-up flow** in incognito mode to ensure proper session handling

## Recent Fixes (Latest Update)

### Added Google Analytics 4 Integration
- **Feature**: Comprehensive user behavior tracking
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added GA4 tracking script to root layout
  - Created analytics utility functions for event tracking
  - Integrated tracking across all major user interactions
  - Added admin action tracking for content management
  - Implemented error tracking integration with Sentry
- **Events Tracked**: User auth, widget interactions, business actions, admin actions, navigation, errors
- **Privacy**: No PII sent to GA4, GDPR/CCPA compliant

### Fixed Widget Rendering Issues
- **Issue**: Widget was not rendering due to dependency loading failures
- **Root Cause**: Swiper CDN loading issues and complex dependency management
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `widget-embed-working.js` with smart fallback system
  - Widget tries Swiper first, falls back to grid layout if it fails
  - All styles are inline - no external CSS dependencies
  - Always renders something useful, never fails completely

### Fixed Infinite Loop in Test Page
- **Issue**: Test page was showing infinite "Test page loaded" messages in debug console
- **Root Cause**: Conflict between automatic widget initialization and manual test data rendering
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed test page container ID from `promptreviews-widget` to `test-widget-container`
  - This prevents the widget script's automatic initialization from conflicting with manual test rendering
  - Test page now uses dedicated container that bypasses automatic API calls

### Fixed "Element type is invalid" Error
- **Issue**: Application was crashing with "Element type is invalid" error due to conflicting type definitions
- **Root Cause**: Multiple `WidgetData` and `DesignState` interfaces were defined in different files, causing import conflicts
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed `MultiWidget.tsx` to import types from local `./index` file instead of `../../shared/types`
  - Fixed `SingleWidget.tsx` to use consistent type definitions
  - Simplified widget components to avoid complex type transformations
  - Restored `ConsoleLogger.tsx` component that was accidentally cleared

### Font System Optimization
- **Issue**: Layout was loading 30+ fonts but only using 6 in widget styling
- **Solution**: 
  - Restored all Google Fonts needed for prompt page styling (30+ fonts)
  - Maintained widget styling fonts (6 fonts: Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat, Poppins)
  - Kept system fonts separate (no import needed)

### Test Page Access
- **Issue**: Test pages were being accessed with incorrect URLs (`/public/widgets/...`)
- **Solution**: 
  - Correct URL format: `/widgets/multi/test-multiple.html` (without `/public` prefix)
  - Static files in `/public` directory are served from root URL

## Working Test Pages

### 1. Working Widget Test (Recommended)
**URL**: `http://localhost:3001/widgets/multi/working-test.html`
- **Features**: Full Swiper carousel with navigation arrows and pagination
- **Fallback**: Automatically falls back to grid layout if Swiper fails
- **Responsive**: 3 cards on desktop ‚Üí 2 on tablet ‚Üí 1 on mobile
- **Script**: Uses `widget-embed-working.js` (most reliable)

### 2. Ultra Simple Test
**URL**: `http://localhost:3001/widgets/multi/ultra-simple-test.html`
- **Features**: Simple grid layout, no external dependencies
- **Use Case**: Basic testing when you need guaranteed rendering
- **Script**: Self-contained, no external scripts

### 3. Original Test (Legacy)
**URL**: `http://localhost:3001/widgets/multi/test-embed.html`
- **Features**: Original widget script with Swiper
- **Status**: May have dependency issues, use working-test.html instead
- **Script**: Uses `widget-embed.js` (original version)

## Widget Scripts

### widget-embed-working.js (Recommended)
- **Smart fallback system**: Tries Swiper, falls back to grid
- **All inline styles**: No external CSS dependencies
- **Better error handling**: Detailed logging and timeout protection
- **Always renders**: Never fails completely

### widget-embed.js (Legacy)
- **Original implementation**: Complex dependency loading
- **External CSS**: Requires `multi-widget.css`
- **May fail**: Can get stuck in loading state

   - Live preview in the dashboard

2. **Review Management**
   - Create, edit, and delete reviews
   - Photo upload support
   - Star rating system

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-friendly layouts
   - Adaptive widget sizes
   - Touch-friendly controls

### Best Practices

1. **Component Organization**
   - Keep components focused and single-purpose
   - Use shared components for common functionality
   - Maintain consistent file structure

2. **Styling**
   - Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
   - Follow the project's color scheme
   - Maintain responsive design

3. **Type Safety**
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
   - Maintain strict type checking
   - Document complex types

### Common Patterns

1. **Widget Implementation**
   ```typescript
   interface WidgetProps {
     reviews: Review[];
     design: DesignState;
     onDesignChange?: (design: DesignState) => void;
   }
   ```

2. **Design State**
   ```typescript
   interface DesignState {
     colors: {
       primary: string;
       secondary: string;
       text: string;
     };
     typography: {
       fontFamily: string;
       fontSize: string;
     };
     layout: {
       padding: string;
       borderRadius: string;
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Review Data**
   ```typescript
   interface Review {
     id: string;
     author: string;
     content: string;
     star_rating: number;
     photo_url?: string;
     created_at: string;
   }
   ```

## Deployment

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Widget-Embed Folder**
   - Contains client-side widget implementation
   - Not intended for dashboard functionality
   - Keep widget-specific code in dashboard components

2. **Star Rating System**
   - Use the shared `StarRating` component
   - Maintain consistent styling across widgets
   - Support half-star ratings

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize image loading
   - Implement lazy loading for widgets
   - Cache design settings

4. **Security**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize review content
   - Secure photo uploads

## Troubleshooting

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3001
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

2. **Build Cache Issues**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Type Errors**
   - Check interface definitions
   - Verify prop types
   - Update TypeScript configurations

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code structure
2. Maintain type safety
3. Use Tailwind for styling
4. Document new features
5. Update this README as needed

## [2024-06-08] Dashboard Widget Preview: Swiper Global Loading Fix

- The dashboard widget preview now waits for the Swiper script to be available globally (`window.Swiper`) before rendering the vanilla JS multi-widget.
- This ensures that design changes (such as color) made in the editor are reflected live in the widget preview.
- Previously, if Swiper was not available on the global scope, the widget would not update visually after design changes.
- This fix resolves the issue and improves reliability of the live preview.
