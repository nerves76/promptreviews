## Draft Articles Analysis

### Ready for Development (by priority)

#### Priority 1: Nearly Ready (100-500 characters)
These have basic structure but need expansion:

1. **prompt-pages/types/service** (492 chars)
   - Has good foundation for service-based businesses
   - Needs: More examples, step-by-step guide, best practices
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

#### Priority 2: Stubs Needing Full Content (35-89 characters)
These have metadata but minimal content:

**Prompt Page Types** (high value for users):
1. **prompt-pages/features** (89 chars) - Essential for understanding features
2. **prompt-pages/types** (76 chars) - Overview needed
3. **prompt-pages/types/universal** (71 chars) - Most used page type
4. **prompt-pages/types/video** (64 chars) - High-value feature
5. **prompt-pages/types/employee** (62 chars) - Unique differentiator
6. **prompt-pages/types/photo** (60 chars) - Popular feature
7. **prompt-pages/types/event** (59 chars) - Niche but important
8. **prompt-pages/types/product** (56 chars) - E-commerce focus

**Getting Started Series** (high SEO value):
9. **getting-started/account-setup** (51 chars)
10. **getting-started/first-review-request** (49 chars)
11. **getting-started/first-prompt-page** (48 chars)

17. **integrations** (40 chars) - Growing category
18. **features** (36 chars) - Marketing/overview page

#### Priority 3: Placeholder Articles (10 characters - "Untitled")
These need complete authoring from scratch:

**Strategy Sub-pages** (could be published as sections of main strategies article):
- strategies/reviews-on-fly
- strategies/double-dip
- strategies/non-ai-strategies
- strategies/novelty
- strategies/personal-outreach
- strategies/reciprocity

**Other Placeholders**:
- google-biz-optimizer (potential product feature)
