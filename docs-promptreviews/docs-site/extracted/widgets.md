# Review widgets for your website

Create customizable widgets to display your reviews on any website. Choose from different layouts, customize colors and styling, and embed with simple HTML code.

## Key Features

### Multiple Layout Options

Choose from list view, card layout, compact sidebar view, or full-width testimonial style to match your website design.

### Complete Customization

Customize colors, fonts, borders, shadows, and star rating colors to perfectly match your brand identity.

### Advanced Filtering

Filter reviews by rating, date, or keywords. Set minimum star ratings and control review text length.

### Real-Time Updates

Widgets automatically update when new reviews come in. Changes to your widget settings appear instantly.

### Mobile Responsive

All widgets are fully responsive and look perfect on phones, tablets, and desktops automatically.

### Performance Analytics

Track widget views, engagement, and performance metrics to optimize your social proof strategy.

## How It Works

### 1. Create Your Widget

Go to the Widgets section in your dashboard and click 

### 2. Customize Appearance

Customize colors, fonts, layout, and display options. Filter reviews by rating or date and preview your widget in real-time.

### 3. Get Embed Code

Copy the generated embed code. It's just a simple HTML snippet that works like embedding a YouTube video.

### 4. Add to Your Website

Paste the embed code into your website's HTML. The widget will automatically load and display your reviews beautifully.

## Best Practices

### Strategic Placement

Place widgets where they have maximum impact - homepage testimonial sections, product pages, or checkout pages to build trust at crucial moments.

### Show Your Best Reviews

Use filtering to showcase 4-5 star reviews. Focus on reviews that mention specific benefits or outcomes that matter to your prospects.

### Match Your Brand

Customize colors, fonts, and styling to seamlessly integrate with your website. Widgets should feel like a natural part of your site.

### Keep It Fresh

Regularly update which reviews you display. Fresh, recent reviews are more compelling than outdated ones, even if they're positive.
