## How It Works

### 1. Monitor All Reviews

Your dashboard automatically tracks reviews from all connected platforms and prompt page submissions in one central location.

### 2. Get Instant Alerts

Receive notifications for new reviews, changes in review status, and when responses are needed to maintain your reputation.

### 3. Respond & Engage

Reply to reviews directly from the dashboard, thank positive reviewers, and address concerns from negative feedback professionally.

### 4. Analyze & Improve

## Best Practices

### Respond Quickly

Aim to respond to reviews within 24-48 hours. Quick responses show you care and can turn negative experiences into positive ones.

### Personalize Your Responses

Use the reviewer's name and reference specific details from their review. Avoid generic templates that feel robotic.

### Address Issues Constructively

For negative reviews, acknowledge the issue, apologize if appropriate, and offer to resolve the problem offline.

### Learn from Patterns

Look for recurring themes in feedback to identify systemic issues or consistently praised aspects of your service.
