# Team management & account settings

Add team members, manage permissions, and control account settings. Collaborate effectively while maintaining security and control.

## Key Features

### Team Invitations

Easily invite team members by email and manage their access to different parts of your account. Role-based permissions ensure everyone has appropriate access levels.

### Permission Control

Set different access levels for team members - from full Admin access to limited Member permissions. Maintain security while enabling collaboration.

### Activity Monitoring

Track what team members are doing with activity logs and audit trails. Know who made changes and when for complete transparency.

### Account Settings

Manage general account settings, security preferences, notification settings, and other account-wide configurations from a central location.

## How It Works

### 1. Send Team Invitation

Enter the team member's email address and select their role (Admin or Member). They'll receive an invitation email to join your account.

### 2. Team Member Accepts

The invited team member creates their account or signs in with their existing Prompt Reviews account to accept the invitation.

### 3. Collaboration Begins

Team members can immediately access your account based on their assigned permissions and start collaborating on review management tasks.

## Best Practices

### Use Role-Based Access

Assign appropriate permission levels to maintain security while enabling effective collaboration. Not everyone needs full admin access.

### Regular Access Reviews

Periodically review team member access and remove inactive users. Keep your team list current and secure.

### Enable Two-Factor Auth

Require two-factor authentication for all team members, especially those with admin privileges, to enhance account security.

### Document Processes

Create clear guidelines for team responsibilities, review response procedures, and escalation processes for consistency.
