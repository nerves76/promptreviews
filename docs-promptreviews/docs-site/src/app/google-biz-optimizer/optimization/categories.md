# Business Categories - Google Biz Optimizer™

## What Are Google Business Categories?

Categories tell Google what your business does, directly impacting when and where you appear in search results. They're the foundation of your local SEO strategy.

## Primary vs. Secondary Categories

### Primary Category (Most Important)

- Shows what you primarily do
- Can only have ONE primary

### Secondary Categories (Up to 9)
- Support services you offer
- Capture additional search traffic
- Broaden your visibility
- Strategic differentiation

## Category Impact on Rankings

### The Numbers
- Right primary category: **+42% visibility**
