# PromptReviews Project

This is a vanilla JavaScript project for creating and managing prompt pages that account holders can use to collect reviews. The project uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with no framework dependencies.

Public url is https://app.promptpages.app

It's main function is to create landing pages "prompt pages" that account holders can use to collect reviews. There are different kinds of prompt pages with different purposes.

This project is currently focused on developing a standalone widget for collecting reviews. The widget is being developed as a vanilla JavaScript component first, before being integrated into the larger Next.js application.

## Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Widget Development (Current)
- Focus on widget design and functionality
- Develop as a standalone vanilla JavaScript component
- Test and refine user experience
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Optimize performance and loading times

### Phase 2: Integration (Future)
- Integrate widget with Next.js application
- Connect to backend services
- Implement authentication and data persistence
- Add analytics and monitoring

## Widget Development

The widget is currently being developed as a standalone component in the `public/widgets/multi/` directory:

```
public/widgets/multi/
├── widget-embed.js    # Main widget JavaScript (with responsive fallback)
├── widget-embed.min.js # Minified version for production
├── widget-embed-working.js # Working version with responsive fixes
├── multi-widget.css   # Widget styles
├── test-responsive.html # Test page for responsive behavior
└── working-test.html  # Test page with debug console
```

To test the widget:
1. Open `public/widgets/multi/test-responsive.html` in your browser
2. Make changes to the JavaScript and CSS files
3. Refresh to see your changes
4. Test responsive behavior by resizing the browser window

No build step is required during widget development.

## Widget Responsiveness

The multi-widget now has proper responsive behavior with a dual system:

### Primary: Swiper.js Carousel
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: 3 cards visible with navigation
- **Tablet (768px-1023px)**: 2 cards visible with navigation  
- **Mobile (<768px)**: 1 card visible with navigation

### Fallback: CSS Grid Layout
When Swiper.js fails to load (network issues, CDN problems), the widget falls back to a responsive CSS Grid:
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: 3 cards per row
- **Tablet (768px-1023px)**: 2 cards per row
- **Mobile (<768px)**: 1 card per row

### Key Features
- **Multiple CDN fallbacks** for Swiper.js loading reliability
- **Responsive CSS Grid** with `!important` declarations to override inline styles
- **Graceful degradation** when Swiper fails to load
- **Consistent card styling** between Swiper and Grid modes

### Testing Responsiveness
1. Visit `http://localhost:3001/widgets/multi/test-responsive.html`
2. Resize browser window to test different breakpoints
3. Check browser console for loading status
4. Test with network throttling to simulate slow connections

# **PromptReviews Project Cheat Sheet**

It's important to know that due to a previous issue we use a togglt to embed hard coded keys. ./toggle-supabase-keys.sh

Keys include supabase, Stripe, Resend

## **Project Overview**

- **Stack:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Supabase (DB, Auth, Storage), Tailwind CSS.
- **Purpose:** Business onboarding, authentication, and review management platform with custom prompt pages, AI-generated reviews, and media uploads.

---

## **Key Technologies & Patterns**

### **1. Supabase**

- **Auth, DB, Storage:** All handled via Supabase.
- **Client Usage:**
  - **Use `@supabase/ssr` everywhere** for both client and server (API) code.
    - `createBrowserClient` for client-side (React components/pages).
    - `createServerClient` for server-side (API routes, middleware).
  - **Do NOT mix with `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`** (legacy, only a few old usages remain).

### **2. Authentication**

- **Sign-in/Sign-up:**
  - Use `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr`.
  - Handles both email/password and OAuth (Google).
- **Session Handling:**
  - All session checks and user fetching use the same Supabase client.
  - If session is missing, user is redirected to `/auth/sign-in`.

### **3. Project Structure**

- **Pages:**
  - `src/app/` — Next.js App Router pages.
  - `src/app/dashboard/` — Main dashboard and business management.
  - `src/app/r/[slug]/page.tsx` — Public prompt/review pages.
  - `src/app/auth/` — Auth flows.
  - `src/app/api/` — API routes (server actions).
- **Components:**
  - `src/app/components/` — Shared UI components.
- **Utils:**
  - `src/utils/` — Supabase helpers, guards, etc.

### **4. Review & Prompt Pages**

- **Prompt Pages:**
  - Can be for platforms (Google, Yelp, etc.), video, photo+testimonial, or universal.
  - AI-generated review/testimonial support.
  - Media upload (photo/video) via Supabase Storage.

### **5. Business Logic**

- **Business Profiles:**
  - Each user can create/manage a business profile.
  - Business data is stored in the `businesses` table.
- **Review Submissions:**
  - Stored in `review_submissions` table.
  - Includes text, media URLs, reviewer info, etc.

---

## **Common Gotchas & Best Practices**

- **Always use the same Supabase client (`@supabase/ssr`) everywhere.**
- **Check for null/undefined user/session before accessing properties.**
- **If you see `AuthSessionMissingError`, the session is missing or expired.**
- **Environment variables:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` must be set and correct.
  - Restart the dev server after changing env vars.
- **Do not use or reintroduce `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` unless refactoring the whole app.**
- **For new features:**
  - Follow the pattern of using `createBrowserClient` for all Supabase operations in client components.
  - Use `createServerClient` for API routes.

## **Updating Widget Styles (Tailwind CSS Build)**

**Widget CSS Management:**

- All widget styles are managed directly in `public/widget.css`
- This file is served directly to users and embedded sites
- To modify widget styles:
  1. Edit `public/widget.css` directly
  2. Test your changes locally
  3. Commit and push the changes
  4. Deploy to update the live widget styles

Note: The widget CSS is now managed manually to ensure reliable updates and direct control over the final output.

**How the build works (now automated):**

- The `package.json` build script runs:
  ```sh
  npx tailwindcss -i ./src/widget-embed/widget.css -o ./public/widget.css --minify
  ```
  as part of every Vercel deployment.
- **You do NOT need to run this command manually before pushing.**
- Vercel will always generate the latest CSS from your source on every deploy.
- A safelist is included in `src/widget-embed/widget.css` to ensure all Tailwind utility classes used in widget JSX are present in the final CSS, even if not detected by Tailwind's scan.

**How to update widget styles:**

1. Edit your styles in `src/widget-embed/widget.css` (and/or your widget JSX).
2. Commit and push your changes.
3. Vercel will build and deploy the correct, up-to-date CSS automatically.

**Summary:**
- No more manual CSS builds needed.
- No more missing classes in production.
- Just edit, commit, and push—Vercel takes care of the rest.

For more details, see the safelist comment in `src/widget-embed/widget.css`.

**Tip:**
- You can add this to your `package.json` scripts for convenience:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build:widget:css": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/widget-embed/widget.css -o ./public/widget.css --minify"
  }
  ```
  Then just run:
  ```sh
  npm run build:widget:css
  ```

---

## **Debugging Tips**

- **If login/auth breaks:**
  - Check for mixed Supabase client usage.
  - Clear cookies/localStorage and try again.
  - Check for errors in the browser console and network tab.
- **If you see session errors:**
  - Make sure you're not running the app on multiple ports/domains.
  - Make sure you're not in incognito/private mode (unless testing).
- **If uploads fail:**
  - Check Supabase Storage bucket permissions and policy.
  - Check file size/type limits.
- **If widget responsiveness breaks:**
  - Check browser console for Swiper loading errors
  - Test with network throttling to simulate slow connections
  - Verify CSS media queries are applying correctly
  - Test on different screen sizes using browser dev tools

---

## **How to Add a New Feature**

1. **Create a new page/component in `src/app/` or `src/app/dashboard/`.**
2. **Use `createBrowserClient` for Supabase operations.**
3. **Add any new DB columns via Supabase SQL editor and update types if needed.**
4. **Test with both a real user and a new incognito session.**
5. **Keep UI/UX consistent with Tailwind and existing design patterns.**

---

## **Where to Look for…**

- **Supabase client setup:**
  - `src/utils/supabase.ts` (for types and helpers)
  - Directly in each page/component via `createBrowserClient`
- **Auth/session logic:**
  - `src/app/auth/sign-in/page.tsx`, `src/app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx`
  - `src/utils/authGuard.ts`
- **Business/profile logic:**
  - `src/app/dashboard/`
- **Prompt/review logic:**
  - `src/app/r/[slug]/page.tsx`
- **API routes:**
  - `src/app/api/`

---

## **Onboarding Checklist**

- [ ] Clone the repo and install dependencies.
- [ ] Set up `.env.local` with Supabase project URL and anon key.
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` and test sign-in/sign-up.
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with `@supabase/ssr` usage.
- [ ] Review the dashboard and prompt page flows.
- [ ] Read through `src/utils/supabase.ts` and `src/utils/authGuard.ts` for helper patterns.

---

**If you follow these patterns and keep Supabase client usage consistent, you'll avoid most session/auth headaches and be productive quickly!**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the project. The page auto-updates as you edit the files.

## Project Structure

- `public/` - Contains all static assets and widget files
  - `widgets/` - Contains the widget implementation files
    - `multi/` - Multi-widget implementation
      - `widget-embed.js` - Main widget JavaScript
      - `widget-embed.css` - Widget styles
      - `multi.html` - Example implementation
- `src/` - Source files for the project
  - `widget-embed/` - Widget source files
    - `widget.css` - Source CSS for widgets
    - `widget.js` - Source JavaScript for widgets

## Development

The project uses a simple development server that serves static files. No framework or build step is required for development.

To modify widget styles:
1. Edit the CSS files directly
2. Test your changes locally
3. Commit and push the changes
4. Deploy to update the live widget styles

## Prompt Page UI Component Library

### Location

All modular, reusable UI components for prompt page modules (such as Special Offer, Emoji Sentiment, Review Platforms, etc.) are stored in:

```
src/app/dashboard/edit-prompt-page/components/
```

### What is stored here

- **Section modules** for the Universal Prompt Page and other prompt page editors, including:
  - `OfferSection.tsx`: Special Offer input module
  - `EmojiSentimentSection.tsx`: Emoji sentiment input module
  - `ReviewPlatformsSection.tsx`: Review platforms input module (platform name, URL, instructions, word count)
  - `ReviewWriteSection.tsx`: Review platforms + review writing/generation (for custom prompt pages)
  - `OfferToggle.tsx`: Simple toggle for enabling/disabling modules
  - `DisableAIGenerationSection.tsx`: Toggle for enabling/disabling the "Generate with AI" button on prompt pages
- **Shared config files** for module defaults (if needed)
- **Any future prompt page modules** (e.g., testimonials, feedback, etc.)

### How to use

- **Import the component** you need into your page or form:
  ```tsx
  import OfferSection from "src/app/dashboard/edit-prompt-page/components/OfferSection";
  import DisableAIGenerationSection from "src/app/components/DisableAIGenerationSection";
  ```
- **Pass in the required props** (see each component's interface for details).
- **Extend or create new modules** by following the same pattern: section header, icon, consistent styling, and modular props.

### Why this structure?

- Keeps all prompt page modules consistent, discoverable, and easy to maintain.
- Makes it easy to reuse modules across Universal, custom, and business profile pages.
- Encourages modular, scalable UI development.

If you want to move these to a more global shared directory (e.g., `src/app/components/prompt-modules/`), refactor as needed and update this section.

## Universal Prompt Page: Business Defaults Fallback Logic

### How it works

- When editing or rendering a Universal Prompt Page, the app fetches both the Universal Prompt Page record and the associated Business Profile.
- For each field (e.g., Special Offer, Review Platforms):
  - If the Universal Prompt Page has a value (not null/empty), use it.
  - Otherwise, use the value from the Business Profile.

**Example:**

```ts
const mergedOfferEnabled =
  universalPage.offerEnabled ?? businessProfile.default_offer_enabled;
const mergedOfferTitle =
  universalPage.offerTitle || businessProfile.default_offer_title;
const mergedReviewPlatforms = universalPage.reviewPlatforms?.length
  ? universalPage.reviewPlatforms
  : businessProfile.review_platforms;
```

### Editing & Saving

- The Universal Prompt Page editor pre-fills fields with merged values (universal override if present, otherwise business default).
- When a user changes a field, it is saved as an override in the Universal Prompt Page record.
- If a field is cleared, you can either:
  - Remove the override (so it falls back to business default), or
  - Save as null/empty to explicitly override.

### Public Prompt Page Rendering

- The public prompt page uses the same merge logic: show the universal value if set, otherwise show the business default.

### Benefits

- **Consistency:** New universal pages are pre-filled with business defaults, reducing setup friction.
- **Flexibility:** Users can override any field for a specific universal page.
- **Maintainability:** If the business profile changes, universal pages that haven't overridden a field will automatically reflect the new default.

### Implementation Notes

- This pattern can be used for any field: offer, review platforms, emoji sentiment, etc.
- You may want to visually indicate in the editor which fields are using business defaults vs. overridden.

### Public Prompt Page Fallback Logic

- The public prompt page (`/r/[slug]`) uses the same fallback logic as the editor:
  - For each field (Special Offer, Review Platforms, Emoji Sentiment, etc.), it uses the value from the prompt page if set, otherwise falls back to the business profile default.
- This ensures that:
  - New prompt pages always display up-to-date business defaults unless/until a value is explicitly overridden in the prompt page.
  - If the business profile is updated, all public prompt pages that haven't overridden a field will automatically reflect the new default.

## Falling Star Animation & Offer Banner Functionality

### Falling Star Animation

- **Purpose:** Adds a celebratory animation (stars, hearts, rainbows, etc.) that falls from the top of the public prompt page.
- **How to Enable:**
  - In the Universal Prompt Page editor, toggle the "Falling star animation" section ON and select an icon.
  - The animation is enabled if an icon is selected (the toggle reflects this state).
  - The selected icon will be saved as `falling_icon` in the database.
- **How it Works:**
  - On the public prompt page, if `falling_icon` is set, the animation will run.
  - If **Emoji Sentiment** is also enabled, the animation will only run after a user selects a positive sentiment ("Excellent" or "Satisfied").
  - If Emoji Sentiment is **not** enabled, the animation runs immediately on page load.
- **Supported Icons:** Stars, hearts, smiles, thumbs up, bolts, rainbows, coffee, wrenches, wine glass, barbell, flower, peace, etc.
- **Persistence:** The toggle and icon selection are synced with the presence of `falling_icon` in the database. If you turn the toggle off, the icon is cleared and the animation is disabled.

### Offer Banner (Special Offer)

- **Purpose:** Displays a slim, dismissible banner at the top of the public prompt page to promote a special offer, code, or link.
- **How to Enable:**
  - In the Universal Prompt Page editor, toggle the "Special Offer" section ON and fill in the title, message, and (optionally) a Learn More URL.
  - The banner is enabled if the toggle is ON and a title/message are provided.
- **How it Works:**
  - The banner appears at the very top of the public prompt page, above all other content.
  - It includes an icon, the offer title, a short message, and a "Learn More" button if a URL is provided.
  - Users can dismiss the banner (it will not reappear until the page is reloaded).
- **Persistence:** The offer settings are saved to the database and reflected on the public page after save.

---

#### DisableAIGenerationSection

**Props:**

- `enabled: boolean` — Whether the AI button is enabled (shown to customers)
- `onToggle: () => void` — Callback to toggle the enabled state

**Purpose:**

- Shows a styled toggle switch and description for enabling/disabling the "Generate with AI" button on the public prompt page.
- Used in both Universal and custom prompt page editors.

**Example:**

```tsx
<DisableAIGenerationSection
  enabled={aiButtonEnabled}
  onToggle={() => setAiButtonEnabled((v) => !v)}
/>
```

---

## Global Loading Spinner and AppLoader

To ensure a consistent loading experience across the app, use the `AppLoader` component for all loading states. This component displays a centered animated five-star spinner (default size 48) and the text "Loading…" in white, making it suitable for both light and dark backgrounds.

### Usage

Import and use `AppLoader` wherever you need a loading state:

```tsx
import AppLoader from "@/app/components/AppLoader";

// ...
if (isLoading) {
  return <AppLoader />;
}
```

### Details

- The spinner is implemented by `FiveStarSpinner` with a default size of 48.
- The loading text is always white and centered below the spinner.
- This ensures all loading states look and feel the same throughout the app.

If you need a custom loading message or style, consider extending `AppLoader` or passing props as needed.

# UI/UX Styles & Component Conventions

## Where to Find Key UI Modules

- **SectionHeader:** `src/app/components/SectionHeader.tsx` — For all section headers with icon, title, and subcopy. Use this for consistent section/module headers.
- **PageCard:** `src/app/components/PageCard.tsx` — For main page/card layout, floating top-left icon, and card-level actions. Always use for dashboard and prompt page forms.
- **ReviewWriteSection:** `src/app/dashboard/edit-prompt-page/components/ReviewWriteSection.tsx` — For review platform cards, AI button, and review template fields.
- **PromptPageForm:** `src/app/components/PromptPageForm.tsx` — Main form for all prompt page types. Shows how to compose all modules and use conventions.

## Visual & Code Conventions

- **Section headers:**
  - Use `<SectionHeader icon={...} title="..." subCopy="..." />` for all major sections.
  - Title: `text-2xl font-bold text-[#1A237E]` (or override with `titleClassName` for page titles).
  - Subcopy: Left-aligned with title, `text-sm text-gray-700`.
- **Page-level icons:**
  - Use the `icon` prop on `PageCard` for a floating, breaching icon in the top-left of the card.
  - Never render the icon manually inside the form/component.
- **AI Gen Button:**
  - Use the standardized button: `inline-flex items-center px-4 py-2 border rounded font-semibold shadow text-slate-blue border-slate-blue bg-white hover:bg-slate-blue/10 transition text-sm whitespace-nowrap w-auto min-w-[180px] self-start gap-2` with `<FaMagic />` and text `Generate with AI`.
  - Always left-aligned, never full width, and never a primary color.
- **Review Platform Cards:**
  - Use `ReviewWriteSection` for all review platform input flows.
  - Each card has a platform icon breaching the top-left, card title, and action buttons at the top.
- **Spacing & Typography:**
  - Follow the rules in `DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` for all spacing, font sizes, and color usage.
  - Main page titles: `text-4xl font-bold text-slate-blue` (pass as `titleClassName` to SectionHeader).

## For Visual Rules & Examples

See `DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` for:

- Color palette
- Icon usage
- Card and section header patterns
- Spacing and typography
- Example code snippets

## Quickstart for New Devs

- All shared UI modules are in `src/app/components/` or `src/app/dashboard/edit-prompt-page/components/`.
- Always use SectionHeader and PageCard for new modules/pages.
- For new AI buttons, copy the style from ReviewWriteSection or PromptPageForm.
- If in doubt, check DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md or ask for a design/code review.

## [2024-06-08] Dashboard Widget Preview: Swiper Global Loading Fix

- The dashboard widget preview now waits for the Swiper script to be available globally (`window.Swiper`) before rendering the vanilla JS multi-widget.
- This ensures that design changes (such as color) made in the editor are reflected live in the widget preview.
- Previously, if Swiper was not available on the global scope, the widget would not update visually after design changes.
- This fix resolves the issue and improves reliability of the live preview.

---
