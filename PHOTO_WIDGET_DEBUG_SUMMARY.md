# Photo Widget Debugging Summary

### Objective
Fix the embeddable Photo Widget so it functions identically to the working Dashboard version and mirrors the stability of the Multi-Widget embed, without breaking any existing functionality.

### Initial Problem
The embedded Photo Widget was not rendering correctly on the `test-widgets.html` page. The issues evolved during debugging:
1.  Initially, review cards were stacked vertically instead of being in a carousel.
2.  After some fixes, the widget failed to load entirely.
3.  After fixing the loading issue, the widget appeared visually broken (missing photo, misplaced controls, not functioning as a carousel).

### Key Findings & Positive Progress
Despite the end result of the last session, a few critical issues were successfully identified and represent forward progress:

1.  **CSS Injection:** The initial "stacked cards" issue was due to the widget's CSS not being loaded by the embed script. This was fixed by ensuring the script dynamically injects the required CSS into the document's `<head>`, a pattern that should be maintained.
2.  **Build Process Error Identified:** A crucial finding was a bug in the minification process that was adding a stray `%` character to the end of `public/widgets/photo/widget-embed.min.js`. This syntax error prevented the script from executing at all and was the reason the widget sometimes failed to load. Manually removing it or ensuring the build script runs correctly is the proper fix.
3.  **Root Cause Pinpointed:** The core visual and functional bugs were traced to incorrect HTML structure being generated by two key functions in `public/widgets/photo/widget-embed.js`:
    *   `createReviewCard`: This function was not correctly assembling the card's HTML to display the reviewer's photo as a background.
    *   `createCarouselHTML`: This function was placing the carousel controls (arrows, dots) and the "Submit a Review" button outside the main widget container, causing them to be misplaced.

### Failed Repair Attempts & Lessons Learned

My attempts to fix the HTML generation logic were flawed and led to the regressions that broke the dashboard.

*   **Mistake:** I attempted to rewrite the logic in the rendering functions (`createReviewCard`, `createCarouselHTML`) instead of making small, precise adjustments.
*   **Critical Error:** This rewrite broke the widget's functionality on the dashboard. It was a stark reminder that this component's code is shared, and any changes must be tested against all use cases (dashboard and embed).
*   **Lesson Learned:** The correct approach is not to redesign but to debug by comparing the broken component to its working counterparts. Future attempts must be much more surgical, focusing on identifying the *exact* structural differences in the generated HTML between the broken embed and the working dashboard version. Reverting via `git restore` is the correct, immediate response to any critical regression.

### Recommended Path Forward
1.  **Verify Restoration:** Confirm that both the Photo and Multi widgets are working correctly on the dashboard and the test page after the `git restore` and `npm run build:widget` commands.
2.  **Surgical Fix:** The next attempt to fix the photo widget embed should focus *only* on the `return` statement of the `createCarouselHTML` function. The goal is to rearrange the existing HTML variables (`reviewCardsHTML`, `controlsHTML`, `submitReviewHTML`) into the correct nested structure, mirroring how a standard carousel is built, without rewriting any other logic.
3.  **Incremental Testing:** Each small change must be followed by a widget rebuild (`npm run build:photo-widget`) and testing on *both* the dashboard and the `test-widgets.html` page to prevent regressions.
