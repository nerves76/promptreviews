  '# Share Reviews on Social Media: Amplify Your Best Testimonials

Turn your best customer reviews into powerful social proof by sharing them across Facebook, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), Instagram, and more. Every positive review is a marketing opportunity waiting to happen.

## Why Share Reviews on Social Media?

### Social Proof Drives Decisions

**91% of consumers** read online reviews before making a purchase decision. When you share customer reviews on social media, you:

- **Build trust instantly** - Real customer voices are more credible than branded content
- **Increase engagement** - User-generated content gets 28% higher engagement than brand posts
- **Drive conversions** - Social proof can increase conversion rates by up to 270%
- **Fill your content calendar** - Reviews provide authentic, ready-to-share content

### Amplify Positive Sentiment

Every great review deserves to be seen by more than just the platform where it was posted:

- ✅ **Cross-platform reach** - Share a Google review on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
- ✅ **Permanent visibility** - Social posts don''t get buried like platform reviews
- ✅ **Targeted audiences** - Share different reviews to different platforms
- ✅ **Brand storytelling** - Reviews showcase real customer experiences

### Free Marketing Content

Your customers are creating your marketing materials for you:

- No design needed - Branded share images generated automatically
- No copywriting needed - Customers wrote compelling testimonials
- Authentic voice - More believable than branded messaging
- Fresh content - New reviews provide regular content opportunities

## Common Questions

**Q: How often should I share reviews?**
A: Aim for 2-3 review shares per week across all platforms. Space them out to avoid appearing repetitive. Quality over quantity.

**Q: Do I need permission to share customer reviews?**
A: If the review was submitted through PromptReviews, you have permission to share it. If including the customer''s name, consider asking permission first, especially for B2B.

**Q: Can I edit the review text before sharing?**
A: You can edit the share caption and context, but don''t change the actual review text. Keep testimonials authentic and unaltered.

**Q: What if a customer asks me to remove a shared review?**
A: Respect their request immediately. Delete the post and mark the review as "do not share" in your system.

**Q: Should I respond to comments on shared reviews?**
A: Yes! Engage with every comment. Thank people for their interest, answer questions, and use it as an opportunity to build relationships.

**Q: Can I share the same review multiple times?**
A: Yes, but space them out (at least 3-6 months apart). You can share the same review on different platforms or reframe it with new context.

**Q: How do I track which reviews I''ve already shared?**
A: The share button shows your share count and share history. Use this to avoid over-sharing the same review.
