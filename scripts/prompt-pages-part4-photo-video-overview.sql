A: Not cash, but consider: discount, free service, gift, or charitable donation in their name.

**Q: How long should the testimonial be?**
A: 100-200 words is ideal. Long enough for detail, short enough for use in various formats.

## Pro Tips for Photo Testimonials

### 1. Start with Your Happiest Customers

- Identify raving fans
- They\'re most likely to participate
- Set the quality bar high
- Use as examples for others

### 2. Make It About Them, Not You

**Frame as:**
- "Share your success story"
- "Inspire others like you"
- "Help others achieve what you did"

**Not:**
- "Help us with marketing"
- "We need testimonials"
- "Do us a favor"

### 3. Create a Gallery or Wall of Fame

**Showcase all photo testimonials:**
- Dedicated website page
- Office wall display
- Social media highlights
- Email newsletter features

**Benefits:**
- Encourages participation
- Celebrates customers
- Builds community
- Provides social proof

### 4. Use in Multiple Formats

Don\'t let photo testimonials sit unused:
- Website homepage/landing pages
- Social media (all platforms)
- Email signatures
- Sales presentations
- Proposal documents
- Print brochures
- Trade show displays
- Case study one-pagers

### 5. Refresh Regularly

Photo testimonials can become stale:
- Request new ones quarterly
- Update as services evolve
- Rotate featured testimonials
- Archive outdated ones

### 6. Make Upload Easy

Technical friction kills completion:
- Mobile-friendly upload
- Large file size support
- Multiple format acceptance
- Clear progress indicators
- Save draft capability

### 7. Follow Up Graciously

**If they complete:**
- Thank them enthusiastically
- Show them how it will be used
- Send them the final materials
- Tag them when you post (with permission)

**If they don\'t:**
- One gentle reminder
- Offer to help with photo
- Make it optional, not pushy
- Move on gracefully
