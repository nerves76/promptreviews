  '# Universal Prompt Page: The All-Purpose Review Collection Solution

The Universal Prompt Page is your always-ready, works-for-everyone review collection tool. One simple URL that any customer can use, any time, from anywhere.

## What Makes It Universal?

Unlike individual prompt pages personalized for specific customers, the Universal Prompt Page is designed to work for **any customer who visits it**. They simply enter their name and email, and the page adapts to collect their review.

Think of it as your business''s main review collection hub‚Äîalways available, never needing customization.

## Why Use a Universal Prompt Page?

### Perfect for Spontaneous Reviews
When a customer says "I''d love to leave you a review!" you can immediately share one link that works for everyone.

### Simplifies Your Workflow
No need to create individual pages for every customer. One link handles it all.

### Ideal for In-Person Interactions
- Print the QR code on receipts
- Display it at your checkout counter
- Add it to business cards
- Include it in email signatures

### Works Across All Channels
- Email campaigns to your entire list
- Social media posts
- Website "Leave a Review" buttons
- In-store signage

## How It Works

1. **Customer visits your Universal Prompt Page**
   - They scan a QR code, click a link, or type the URL

2. **They enter their information**
   - Name and email (you can make email optional)
   - The page personalizes their experience

3. **They write their review**
   - Choose which platform (Google, Yelp, etc.)
   - Use AI assistance if they need help writing
   - Submit their review

4. **Review appears in your dashboard**
   - You can verify it, feature it, or share it
   - Track analytics on who''s leaving reviews

## Universal vs Individual Prompt Pages

| Feature | Universal | Individual |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Setup** | Create once, use forever | Create for each customer |
| **URL** | Same for everyone | Personalized per customer |
| **Best for** | Walk-ins, general campaigns | Follow-ups, personal touchpoints |
| **Pre-filled data** | None | Customer name, service details |
| **Personalization** | Generic greeting | Custom message per customer |

**Use both!** Many businesses use Universal for general collection and Individual for VIP customers or after specific transactions.

## Setup Best Practices

### 1. Choose a Memorable Slug
Your Universal Prompt Page URL will look like:
```
app.promptreviews.app/r/your-business-name
```

Pick something easy to remember and type:
- ‚úÖ `/r/joe-plumbing`
- ‚úÖ `/r/mainstreet-salon`
- ‚ùå `/r/best-plumbing-services-nyc-licensed` (too long)

### 2. Customize Your Page Branding
- Add your logo
- Choose brand colors
- Write a welcoming headline
- Include a photo of your team or location

### 3. Enable the Right Platform Options
Only show platforms you actually have:
- Google Business Profile
- Yelp
- Facebook
- TripAdvisor
- Industry-specific platforms

### 4. Configure Required vs Optional Fields
- **Name**: Usually required
- **Email**: Optional if you want to reduce friction
- **Phone**: Optional, only if you need follow-up ability

## Distribution Strategies

### Physical Distribution
1. **QR Codes**
   - Print on receipts (automatic with many POS systems)
   - Table tents in restaurants
   - Window decals
   - Business cards
   - Thank you cards

2. **Verbal Sharing**
   - Train staff to say: "We''d love your feedback! Just scan this code or visit joe-plumbing.com/review"
   - Make it part of checkout script

### Digital Distribution
1. **Email**
   - Post-service follow-up emails
   - Newsletter footer
   - Email signature

2. **Website**
   - "Leave a Review" button in navigation
   - Footer link
   - Dedicated "/review" page redirect

3. **Social Media**
   - Link in bio (Instagram, TikTok)
   - Pinned post
   - Story highlights

## Advanced Features for Universal Pages

### Emoji Sentiment (Optional)
Let customers quickly rate their experience with emojis before writing:
- üòä Love it
- üôÇ Happy
- üòê Neutral
- üòï Unsatisfied
- üò§ Frustrated

Negative sentiment lets them choose public or private feedback.

### AI Review Generation
Customers who struggle with writing can click "Generate with AI" to get started.

### Grammar Fix
Built-in grammar correction helps customers polish their reviews.

### Multi-Platform Support
One form submission can go to multiple platforms simultaneously.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I have multiple Universal Prompt Pages?**
A: Yes! You might have one per location, service type, or brand. Each gets its own URL.

**Q: Can I change the URL later?**
A: The slug (URL) cannot be changed after creation to prevent broken links. Choose carefully!

**Q: Do I need the email address?**
A: No‚Äîyou can make email optional. However, collecting emails lets you:
- Follow up with customers
- Send review verification emails
- Build your marketing list (with permission)

**Q: Can I see who left reviews?**
A: Yes! The dashboard shows all submissions with customer names and contact info (if collected).

**Q: What if someone leaves a negative review?**
A: Negative emoji sentiments offer the option to send private feedback instead of posting publicly. You see the feedback, they avoid public complaints.

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics for your Universal Prompt Page:
- **Page visits**: How many people clicked the link
- **Conversion rate**: % who actually submitted reviews
- **Platform distribution**: Which review sites people chose
- **Sentiment breakdown**: Overall satisfaction patterns

Good conversion rates:
- Email campaigns: 15-30%
- In-person requests: 30-50%
- QR codes on receipts: 5-15%

## Upgrade Your Strategy

**Start with Universal, add Individual for VIPs**

Most businesses follow this progression:
1. **Month 1**: Deploy Universal page everywhere
2. **Month 2**: Analyze which customers convert best
3. **Month 3**: Create Individual pages for high-value customers
4. **Ongoing**: Use Universal for everyone, Individual for VIPs

The Universal Prompt Page handles 80% of your review collection needs‚Äîit''s the foundation of a solid review strategy.',

  '# Location Prompt Pages: Collect Location-Specific Reviews

For businesses with multiple locations, Location Prompt Pages let you collect reviews for each specific branch, store, or office‚Äîkeeping your reviews organized and actionable.

## What Are Location Prompt Pages?

Location Prompt Pages create a unique review collection page for each of your business locations. Each location gets its own:
- Dedicated URL (e.g., `/r/your-business-downtown`)
- Custom branding and messaging
- Separate analytics and review tracking
- Google Business Profile integration per location

## Why Use Location-Specific Pages?

### Accurate Review Attribution
When you have multiple locations, you need to know **which location** earned which review.

**Without Location Pages:**
- All reviews go to one central page
- Can''t track performance by location
- Hard to identify problem areas
- Google reviews get misdirected

**With Location Pages:**
- Each location''s reviews are tracked separately
- Identify top and underperforming locations
- Direct Google reviews to the correct listing
- Managers see only their location''s feedback

### Location-Specific Google Business Profiles
Each of your locations has its own Google Business Profile. Location Prompt Pages integrate with the correct GBP for each location.

### Manager Accountability
Give each location manager their own review collection tool with isolated analytics.

### Localized Marketing
Different locations can have different:
- QR codes and promotional materials
- Team photos and branding
- Special offers or messaging
- Hours and contact information

## How They Work

### Setup Process
1. **Connect your Google Business Profile**
   - Import all your locations automatically
   - Or add locations manually

2. **Create Location Prompt Pages**
   - One click to create pages for all locations
   - Or create selectively for specific branches

3. **Customize per location** (optional)
   - Add location-specific photos
   - Customize messaging
   - Set location hours
   - Add manager contact info

4. **Distribute to customers**
   - Each location gets unique QR codes
   - Location-specific URLs for emails
   - Print materials per branch

### Customer Experience
1. Customer visits location-specific URL
2. Page shows location name, address, photo
3. Customer enters their info
4. They write review for that specific location
5. Review directs to correct Google listing

## Location Pages vs Universal Pages

| Feature | Location Pages | Universal Page |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Number of pages** | One per location | One for all |
| **Google integration** | Separate per location | General only |
| **Analytics** | By location | Combined |
| **URL** | `/r/business-downtown` | `/r/business` |
| **Best for** | Multi-location businesses | Single-location or general |
| **Manager access** | Per-location filtering | All reviews |

**Use both!** Many businesses use Location Pages for location-specific campaigns and a Universal Page for general branding.

## Setup Best Practices

### 1. Import from Google Business
The fastest way to set up Location Pages:
1. Connect your Google Business Profile
2. Click "Import Locations"
3. Select which locations to create pages for

### 3. Location-Specific Customization
Consider customizing for each location:
- **High-traffic locations**: Add special branding, highlight popular services
- **New locations**: Include opening date, welcome message

- **Struggling locations**: Emphasize improvement efforts

### 4. Manager Training
Ensure each location manager knows:

**Q: Can I delete a location if we close it?**
A: Yes, but existing reviews and analytics are preserved. The page becomes inactive.

**Q: Do all locations have to use the same platform options?**
A: No! You can customize which platforms (Google, Yelp, etc.) appear per location.
